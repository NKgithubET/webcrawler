      " Given an unsorted array of integers, sort the array into a wave like array. An array ‘arr[0..n-1]’ is sorted in wave form if arr[0] >= arr[1] <= arr[2] >= arr[3] <= arr[4] >= …..Examples:A Simple Solution is to use sorting. First sort the input array, then swap all adjacent elements.For example, let the input array be {3, 6, 5, 10, 7, 20}. After sorting, we get {3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 20}. After swapping adjacent elements, we get {5, 3, 7, 6, 20, 10}.Below are implementations of this simple approach.Output:The time complexity of the above solution is O(nLogn) if a O(nLogn) sorting algorithm like Merge Sort, Heap Sort, .. etc is used.This can be done in O(n) time by doing a single traversal of given array. The idea is based on the fact that if we make sure that all even positioned (at index 0, 2, 4, ..) elements are greater than their adjacent odd elements, we don’t need to worry about odd positioned element. Following are simple steps. 1) Traverse all even positioned elements of input array, and do following. ….a) If current element is smaller than previous odd element, swap previous and current. ….b) If current element is smaller than next odd element, swap next and current.Below are implementations of above simple algorithm.Output:This article is contributed by Shivam.

      " Given number of pages in n different books and m students. The books are arranged in ascending order of number of pages. Every student is assigned to read some consecutive books. The task is to assign books in such a way that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum. Example :The idea is to use Binary Search. We fix a value for the number of pages as mid of current minimum and maximum. We initialize minimum and maximum as 0 and sum-of-all-pages respectively. If a current mid can be a solution, then we search on the lower half, else we search in higher half.Now the question arises, how to check if a mid value is feasible or not? Basically, we need to check if we can assign pages to all students in a way that the maximum number doesn’t exceed current value. To do this, we sequentially assign pages to every student while the current number of assigned pages doesn’t exceed the value. In this process, if the number of students becomes more than m, then the solution is not feasible. Else feasible.Below is an implementation of above idea.Output :This article is contributed by Sahil Chhabra (akku).

      " Given an array of words, print all anagrams together. For example, if the given array is {“cat”, “dog”, “tac”, “god”, “act”}, then output may be “cat tac act dog god”.A simple method is to create a Hash Table. Calculate the hash value of each word in such a way that all anagrams have the same hash value. Populate the Hash Table with these hash values. Finally, print those words together with the same hash values. A simple hashing mechanism can be modulo sum of all characters. With modulo sum, two non-anagram words may have the same hash value. This can be handled by matching individual characters.Following is another method to print all anagrams together. Take two auxiliary arrays, index array, and word array. Populate the word array with the given sequence of words. Sort each individual word of the word array. Finally, sort the word array and keep track of the corresponding indices. After sorting, all the anagrams cluster together. Use the index array to print the strings from the original array of strings.Let us understand the steps with the following input Sequence of Words:1) Create two auxiliary arrays index[] and words[]. Copy all given words to words[] and store the original indexes in index[]2) Sort individual words in words[]. Index array doesn’t change.3) Sort the words array. Compare individual words using strcmp() to sort4) All anagrams come together. But words are changed in the words array. To print the original words, take the index from the index array and use it in the original array. We getFollowing are the implementations of the above algorithm. In the following program, an array of structure “Word” is used to store both index and word arrays. Dupray is another structure that stores an array of structure “Word”.Output:Time Complexity: Let there be N-words and each word has a maximum of M characters. The upper bound is O(NMLogM + MNLogN). Step 2 takes O(NMLogM) time. Sorting a word takes maximum O(MLogM) time. So sorting N-words takes O(NMLogM) time. step 3 takes O(MNLogN) Sorting array of words takes NLogN comparisons. A comparison may take maximum O(M) time. So time to sort an array of words will be O(MNLogN).Using vector of pair :The problem can easily be solved with the use of a vector of pairs. The pair will be of string and int. The string will require to store the input string and int will require to store their respective indexes.here is the implementation of the above approach:Time complexity:Let there be N-words and each word has a maximum of M characters.O(NMLogM + MNLogN).Using hashmapHere, we first sort each word, use the sorted word as a key and then put an original word on a map. The value of the map will be a list containing all the words which have the same word after sorting. Lastly, we will print all values from the hashmap where the size of values will be greater than 1.Output :HashMap with O(NM) SolutionIn the previous approach, we were sorting every string in order to maintain a similar key, but that cost extra time in this approach will take the advantage of another hashmap to maintain the frequency of the characters which will generate the same hash function for different string having same frequency of characters.Here, we will take HashMap<HashMap, ArrayList>, the inner hashmap will count the frequency of the characters of each string and the outer HashMap will check whether that hashmap is present or not if present then it will add that string to the corresponding list.Output:Time Complexity: Let there be N-words and each word has a maximum of M characters. The upper bound is O(NM). Space Complexity: Let there be N-words and each word has maximum M characters, therefore max. storage space for each word with at max. M characters will be O(M), therefore for max N-words, it will be O(N*M). Therefore, the upper bound is O(NM).Given a sequence of words, print all anagrams together | Set 2 Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Given a string str, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.The desired time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string.Method 1 (Simple : O(n3)): We can consider all substrings one by one and check for each substring whether it contains all unique characters or not. There will be n*(n+1)/2 substrings. Whether a substring contains all unique characters or not can be checked in linear time by scanning it from left to right and keeping a map of visited characters. Time complexity of this solution would be O(n^3).Method 2 (Better : O(n2)) The idea is to use window sliding. Whenever we see repetition, we remove the previous occurrence and slide the window.Method 3 ( Linear Time ): Using this solution the problem can be solved in linear time using the window sliding technique. Whenever we see repetition, we remove the window till the repeated string.Method 4 (Linear Time): Let us talk about the linear time solution now. This solution uses extra space to store the last indexes of already visited characters. The idea is to scan the string from left to right, keep track of the maximum length Non-Repeating Character Substring seen so far in res. When we traverse the string, to know the length of current window we need two indexes. 1) Ending index ( j ) : We consider current index as ending index. 2) Starting index ( i ) : It is same as previous window if current character was not present in the previous window. To check if the current character was present in the previous window or not, we store last index of every character in an array lasIndex[]. If lastIndex[str[j]] + 1 is more than previous start, then we updated the start index i. Else we keep same i.Below is the implementation of the above approach :Time Complexity: O(n + d) where n is length of the input string and d is number of characters in input string alphabet. For example, if string consists of lowercase English characters then value of d is 26. Auxiliary Space: O(d)Alternate Implementation :As an exercise, try the modified version of the above problem where you need to print the maximum length NRCS also (the above program only prints the length of it).Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Given two integers a and b, how can we evaluate the sum a + b without using operators such as +, -, ++, –, …?An interesting way would be:Despite its awkwardness at first sight, we can easily understand what is happening. First, we created a pointer p. The value of a pointer is a memory address. In this case, the value of p is the address a.Remember: p points to position a. In that example, if we want to know the value of position a (999) we ask to *p. If we want to know the address of variable a (41), we ask to &a.If we evaluated p[b], we’d get the value of memory in position p + b. In fact, we evaluate &p[b], witch is the same as getting address p + b without accessing its value. As p = a, &p[b] will return the address a + b.We don’t want to return a memory address (int*). We want to return an integer (int). So, we cast &p[b] to int.What happens if we change the type of p from char* to int*? Let me fix what I said before: When we evaluate p[b] we don’t evaluate p + b. We evaluate p + sizeof(*p) * b. Why? Imagine this example: Variables of type int occupies fours positions in the memory.This sizeof(*p) considers the quantity of positions each variable occupies in the memory.We want to evaluate p + b. In other words, we want sizeof(*p) equals to 1. Consequently, if *p is a char, we’re happy.Let’s look the sum’s truth table (forgive the carry for now):Looking carefully, we notice that the sum’s and xor’s truth table are the same. It’s 1 only when the input differs.Now, how can we detect carry? Let’s look the carry’s truth table.Looking carefully, we notice that the sum’s and xor’s truth table are the same. It’s 1 only when the input differs.Now, how can we detect carry? Let’s look the carry’s truth table.Looking carefully one more time, we notice that the carry’s and logical and’s truth table are identicals. Now, we have to shift a & 1 to left and sum with a ^ b. However, these operations may have carries as well. No problem, just sum a ^ b with a & 1 shifted to left recursively.This solution has been discussed here.Let’s remember some facts:Keeping that in mind, we can understand this function:This solution has been discussed here.This article is contributed by Igor Carpanese.

      " Write an efficient program to count the number of 1s in the binary representation of an integer.Examples :1. Simple Method Loop through all bits in an integer, check if a bit is set and if it is, then increment the set bit count. See the program below.Output :Time Complexity: Θ(logn) (Theta of logn)Auxiliary Space: O(1)Recursive Approach:Output :Time Complexity: O(log n)Auxiliary Space: O(1)2. Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm: Subtracting 1 from a decimal number flips all the bits after the rightmost set bit(which is 1) including the rightmost set bit. for example : 10 in binary is 00001010 9 in binary is 00001001 8 in binary is 00001000 7 in binary is 00000111 So if we subtract a number by 1 and do it bitwise & with itself (n & (n-1)), we unset the rightmost set bit. If we do n & (n-1) in a loop and count the number of times the loop executes, we get the set bit count. The beauty of this solution is the number of times it loops is equal to the number of set bits in a given integer.Implementation of Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm:Output :Example for Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm:Time Complexity: O(logn)Recursive Approach:Output :3.

So we can avoid a separate function for counting set bits.Output :4. Mapping numbers with the bit. It simply maintains a map(or array) of numbers to bits for a nibble. A Nibble contains 4 bits.

Checking each bit in a number:Each bit in the number is checked for whether it is set or not.

      " We are given an array of n positive elements. we need to find the maximum AND value generated by any pair of element from the array. AND is bitwise & operator.Examples:Naive Approach : Basic Approach is same as maximum xor value. We iterate over all the possible pair and calculate the AND value of those all. Pick the largest value among them. Time complexity of this solution is O(n^2).Output:Better Approach : Idea is based on properties of AND operator. AND operation of any two bits result in 1 iff both bits are 1. We start from the MSB and check whether we have minimum of two elements of array having set value. If yes then that MSB will be part of our solution and be added to result otherwise we will discard that bit. Similarly, iterating from MSB to LSB (32 to 1) for bit position we can easily check which bit will be part of our solution and will keep adding all such bits to our solution.Explanation : Lets consider 1st example of {4, 8, 12, 16} :step 1: Write Bit-representation of each element : 4 = 100, 8 = 1000, 12 = 1100, 16 = 10000 step 2: Check for 1st MSB , pattern = 0 + 16 = 16. Now 5th bit in 16 is set but no other element has 5-bit as set bit so this will not add up to our RES, still RES = 0 and pattern = 0 step 3: Check 4th bit, pattern = 0 + 8 = 8. Now 8 and 12 both have set bit on 4th bit position so that will add up in our solution, RES = 8 and pattern = 8 step 4: Check 3rd bit, pattern = 8 + 4 = 12. Now only 12 has both bits set bit (same as pattern) so we will discard 3rd bit, RES = 8 and pattern = 8 step 5: Check 2nd bit, pattern = 8 + 2 = 10. No element has set bit same as pattern so we will discard 2nd bit, RES = 8 and pattern = 8 step 4: Check 1st bit, pattern = 8 + 1 = 9. No element has set bit same as pattern so we will discard 1st bit, RES = 8 and pattern = 8Output:Time Complexity : O(n * log(m)) where m is the maximum element from the array and n is the size of the array.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Given an set of positive integers. find the maximum XOR subset value in the given set. Expected time complexity O(n).Examples:Note that this problem is different from the maximum subarray XOR. Here we need to find subset instead of subarray.A Simple Solution is to generate all possible subsets of given set, find XOR of every subset and return the subset with maximum XOR.Below is an Efficient Algorithm that works in O(n) time. The idea is based on below facts:Below is the implementation of this algorithm.Output:Time Complexity: O(n)Auxiliary Space: O(1)Illustration:How does this work? Let us first understand a simple case when all elements have Most Significant Bits (MSBs) at different positions. The task in this particular case is simple, we need to do XOR of all elements. If input contains multiple numbers with the same MSB, then it’s not obvious which of them we should choose to include in the XOR. What we do is reduce the input list into an equivalent form that doesn’t contain more than one number of the same length. By taking the maximum element, we know that the MSB of this is going to be there in output. Let this MSB be at position i. If there are more elements with i’th set (or same MSB), we XOR them with the maximum number so that the i’th bit becomes 0 in them and problem reduces to i-1 bits. References: http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/48682/maximization-with-xor-operatorNote: The above method is similar to Gaussian elimination.

Given a number N, generate bit patterns from 0 to 2^N-1 such that successive patterns differ by one bit.Examples:Method-1The above sequences are Gray Codes of different widths. Following is an interesting pattern in Gray Codes. n-bit Gray Codes can be generated from list of (n-1)-bit Gray codes using following steps.For example, following are steps for generating the 3-bit Gray code list from the list of 2-bit Gray code list. L1 = {00, 01, 11, 10} (List of 2-bit Gray Codes) L2 = {10, 11, 01, 00} (Reverse of L1) Prefix all entries of L1 with ‘0’, L1 becomes {000, 001, 011, 010} Prefix all entries of L2 with ‘1’, L2 becomes {110, 111, 101, 100} Concatenate L1 and L2, we get {000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100}To generate n-bit Gray codes, we start from list of 1 bit Gray codes. The list of 1 bit Gray code is {0, 1}.

      " Given an integer array of n integers, find sum of bit differences in all pairs that can be formed from array elements. Bit difference of a pair (x, y) is count of different bits at same positions in binary representations of x and y. For example, bit difference for 2 and 7 is 2. Binary representation of 2 is 010 and 7 is 111 ( first and last bits differ in two numbers).Examples :Source: Google Interview QuestionNaive Solution – A Simple Solution is to run two loops to consider all pairs one by one. For every pair, count bit differences. Finally return sum of counts. Time complexity of this solution is O(n2). We are using bitset::count() which is an inbuilt STL in C++ which returns the number of set bits in the binary representation of a number.Time Complexity: O(n2)Auxiliary Space: O(1)Efficient Solution –An Efficient Solution can solve this problem in O(n) time using the fact that all numbers are represented using 32 bits (or some fixed number of bits). The idea is to count differences at individual bit positions. We traverse from 0 to 31 and count numbers with i’th bit set. Let this count be ‘count’. There would be “n-count” numbers with i’th bit not set. So count of differences at i’th bit would be “count * (n-count) * 2”, the reason for this formula is as every pair having one element which has set bit at i’th position and second element having unset bit at i’th position contributes exactly 1 to sum, therefore total permutation count will be count*(n-count) and multiply by 2 is due to one more repetition of all this type of pair as per given condition for making pair 1<=i, j<=N.Below is implementation of above idea.Output :Time Complexity: O(n)Auxiliary Space: O(1)Thanks to Gaurav Ahirwar for suggesting this solution.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Write a SortedMerge() function that takes two lists, each of which is sorted in increasing order, and merges the two together into one list which is in increasing order. SortedMerge() should return the new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.For example if the first linked list a is 5->10->15 and the other linked list b is 2->3->20, then SortedMerge() should return a pointer to the head node of the merged list 2->3->5->10->15->20.There are many cases to deal with: either ‘a’ or ‘b’ may be empty, during processing either ‘a’ or ‘b’ may run out first, and finally, there’s the problem of starting the result list empty, and building it up while going through ‘a’ and ‘b’.Method 1 (Using Dummy Nodes) The strategy here uses a temporary dummy node as the start of the result list. The pointer Tail always points to the last node in the result list, so appending new nodes is easy.The dummy node gives the tail something to point to initially when the result list is empty. This dummy node is efficient, since it is only temporary, and it is allocated in the stack. The loop proceeds, removing one node from either ‘a’ or ‘b’, and adding it to the tail. WhenWe are done, the result is in dummy.next.The below image is a dry run of the above approach:Below is the implementation of the above approach:Output :Method 2 (Using Local References) This solution is structurally very similar to the above, but it avoids using a dummy node. Instead, it maintains a struct node** pointer, lastPtrRef, that always points to the last pointer of the result list. This solves the same case that the dummy node did — dealing with the result list when it is empty. If you are trying to build up a list at its tail, either the dummy node or the struct node** “reference” strategy can be used (see Section 1 for details).Method 3 (Using Recursion) Merge is one of those nice recursive problems where the recursive solution code is much cleaner than the iterative code. You probably wouldn’t want to use the recursive version for production code, however, because it will use stack space which is proportional to the length of the lists.Time Complexity:  Since we are traversing through the two lists fully. So, the time complexity is O(m+n) where m and n are the lengths of the two lists to be merged.Method 4 (Reversing The Lists)This idea involves first reversing both the given lists and after reversing, traversing both the lists till the end and then comparing the nodes of both the lists and inserting the node with a larger value at the beginning of the result list. And in this way we will get the resulting list in increasing order.Below is the implementation of above solution.Output:Time Complexity:  Since we are traversing through the two lists fully. So, the time complexity is O(m+n) where m and n are the lengths of the two lists to be merged.This method is contributed by Mehul Mathur(mathurmehul01).This idea is similar to this post.Please refer below post for simpler implementations : Merge two sorted lists (in-place)Source: http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/105/LinkedListProblems.pdfPlease write comments if you find the above code/algorithm incorrect, or find better ways to solve the same problem.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " You are given a singly linked list and pointer which is pointing to the node which is required to be deleted. Any information about head pointer or any other node is not given. You need to write a function to delete that node from linked list. Your function will take only one argument, i.e., pointer to the node which is to be deleted.Note: No head reference is given to you. It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not the last node.A linked list is built as:Definition of each node is as follows: struct Node {    int data;    struct Node* next;};Examples:Consider below LL for given examples:Input : C (a pointer to C)Output : A–>B–>D–>E–>FInput : A (a pointer to A)Output : B–>D–>E–>FApproach:Why conventional deletion method would fail here?It would be a simple deletion problem from the singly linked list if the head pointer was given because for deletion you must know the previous node and you can easily reach there by traversing from the head pointer. Conventional deletion is impossible without knowledge of the previous node of a node that needs to be deleted.How to delete the node when you dont have the head pointer?The trick here is we can copy the data of the next node to the data field of the current node to be deleted. Then we can move one step forward. Now our next has become the current node and the current has become the previous node. Now we can easily delete the current node by conventional deletion methods.Illustration:For example, suppose we need to delete B and a pointer to B is given.If we had a pointer to A, we could have deleted B easily. But here we will copy the data field of C to the data field of B. Then we will move forward.Now we are at C and we have a pointer to B i.e. the previous pointer. So we will delete C.That’s how node B will be deleted.Below image is a dry run of the above approach:Below is the implementation of the above approach :This article is contributed by Jeet Jain.

      " Write a function detectAndRemoveLoop() that checks whether a given Linked List contains loop and if loop is present then removes the loop and returns true. If the list doesn’t contain loop then it returns false. Below diagram shows a linked list with a loop. detectAndRemoveLoop() must change the below list to 1->2->3->4->5->NULL.We also recommend to read following post as a prerequisite of the solution discussed here. Write a C function to detect loop in a linked listBefore trying to remove the loop, we must detect it. Techniques discussed in the above post can be used to detect loop. To remove loop, all we need to do is to get pointer to the last node of the loop. For example, node with value 5 in the above diagram. Once we have pointer to the last node, we can make the next of this node as NULL and loop is gone. We can easily use Hashing or Visited node techniques (discussed in the above mentioned post) to get the pointer to the last node. Idea is simple: the very first node whose next is already visited (or hashed) is the last node. We can also use Floyd Cycle Detection algorithm to detect and remove the loop. In the Floyd’s algo, the slow and fast pointers meet at a loop node. We can use this loop node to remove cycle. There are following two different ways of removing loop when Floyd’s algorithm is used for Loop detection.Method 1 (Check one by one) We know that Floyd’s Cycle detection algorithm terminates when fast and slow pointers meet at a common point. We also know that this common point is one of the loop nodes (2 or 3 or 4 or 5 in the above diagram). Store the address of this in a pointer variable say ptr2. After that start from the head of the Linked List and check for nodes one by one if they are reachable from ptr2. Whenever we find a node that is reachable, we know that this node is the starting node of the loop in Linked List and we can get the pointer to the previous of this node.Output:Method 2 (Better Solution)Thanks to WgpShashank for suggesting this method.Below image is a dry run of ‘remove loop’ function in the code :Below is the implementation of the above approach:Output:Method 3 (Optimized Method 2: Without Counting Nodes in Loop) We do not need to count number of nodes in Loop. After detecting the loop, if we start slow pointer from head and move both slow and fast pointers at same speed until fast don’t meet, they would meet at the beginning of the loop.How does this work? Let slow and fast meet at some point after Floyd’s Cycle finding algorithm. Below diagram shows the situation when cycle is found.We can conclude below from above diagramFrom above equation, we can conclude belowSo if we start moving both pointers again at same speed such that one pointer (say slow) begins from head node of linked list and other pointer (say fast) begins from meeting point. When slow pointer reaches beginning of loop (has made m steps), fast pointer would have made also moved m steps as they are now moving same pace. Since m+k is a multiple of n and fast starts from k, they would meet at the beginning. Can they meet before also? No because slow pointer enters the cycle first time after m steps.Output:Method 4 Hashing: Hash the address of the linked list nodes We can hash the addresses of the linked list nodes in an unordered map and just check if the element already exists in the map. If it exists, we have reached a node which already exists by a cycle, hence we need to make the last node’s next pointer NULL.We Thank Shubham Agrawal for suggesting this solution.Thanks to Gaurav Ahirwar for suggesting the above solution.Please write comments if you find the above codes/algorithms incorrect, or find other ways to solve the same problem.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Merge sort is often preferred for sorting a linked list. The slow random-access performance of a linked list makes some other algorithms (such as quicksort) perform poorly, and others (such as heapsort) completely impossible.Let the head be the first node of the linked list to be sorted and headRef be the pointer to head. Note that we need a reference to head in MergeSort() as the below implementation changes next links to sort the linked lists (not data at the nodes), so the head node has to be changed if the data at the original head is not the smallest value in the linked list.Time Complexity: O(n*log n)Space Complexity: O(n*log n)Approach 2: This approach is simpler and uses log n space.mergeSort():merge(head1, head2):Output:Time Complexity: O(n*log n)Space Complexity: O(log n)Sources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/105/LinkedListProblems.pdfPlease write comments if you find the above code/algorithm incorrect, or find better ways to solve the same problem.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. Where k is a given positive integer. For example, if the given linked list is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40. Assume that k is smaller than the count of nodes in a linked list.Method-1:To rotate the linked list, we need to change the next of kth node to NULL, the next of the last node to the previous head node, and finally, change the head to (k+1)th node. So we need to get hold of three nodes: kth node, (k+1)th node, and last node. Traverse the list from the beginning and stop at kth node. Store pointer to kth node. We can get (k+1)th node using kthNode->next. Keep traversing till the end and store a pointer to the last node also. Finally, change pointers as stated above.Below image shows how to rotate function works in the code :Output:Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in Linked List. The code traverses the linked list only once.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Method-2:To rotate a linked list by k, we can first make the linked list circular and then moving k-1 steps forward from head node, making (k-1)th node’s next to null and make kth node as head.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Given a linked list where every node represents a linked list and contains two pointers of its type: (i) Pointer to next node in the main list (we call it ‘right’ pointer in the code below) (ii) Pointer to a linked list where this node is headed (we call it the ‘down’ pointer in the code below). All linked lists are sorted. See the following exampleWrite a function flatten() to flatten the lists into a single linked list. The flattened linked list should also be sorted. For example, for the above input list, output list should be 5->7->8->10->19->20->22->28->30->35->40->45->50.The idea is to use the Merge() process of merge sort for linked lists. We use merge() to merge lists one by one. We recursively merge() the current list with the already flattened list. The down pointer is used to link nodes of the flattened list.Below is the implementation of the above approach:Time Complexity: O(N*N*M) – where N is the no of nodes in main linked list (reachable using right pointer) and M is the no of node in a single sub linked list (reachable using down pointer).Explaination: As we are merging 2 lists at a time,Space Complexity: O(N*M) – because of the recursion. The recursive functions will use recursive stack of size equivalent to total number of elements in the lists, which is N*M.Exercise: The above approach can be optimized using priority queue/ min heap. Then the time complexity would be O(N*M*Log(N)) and space complexity would be O(N).Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " There are two singly linked lists in a system. By some programming error, the end node of one of the linked list got linked to the second list, forming an inverted Y shaped list. Write a program to get the point where two linked list merge.Above diagram shows an example with two linked list having 15 as intersection point.Method 1(Simply use two loops) Use 2 nested for loops. The outer loop will be for each node of the 1st list and inner loop will be for 2nd list. In the inner loop, check if any of nodes of the 2nd list is same as the current node of the first linked list. The time complexity of this method will be O(M * N) where m and n are the numbers of nodes in two lists.Method 2 (Mark Visited Nodes) This solution requires modifications to basic linked list data structure. Have a visited flag with each node. Traverse the first linked list and keep marking visited nodes. Now traverse the second linked list, If you see a visited node again then there is an intersection point, return the intersecting node. This solution works in O(m+n) but requires additional information with each node. A variation of this solution that doesn’t require modification to the basic data structure can be implemented using a hash. Traverse the first linked list and store the addresses of visited nodes in a hash. Now traverse the second linked list and if you see an address that already exists in the hash then return the intersecting node.Method 3(Using difference of node counts)Below image is a dry run of the above approach:Below is the implementation of the above approach :Time Complexity: O(m+n) Auxiliary Space: O(1)Method 4(Make circle in first list) Thanks to Saravanan Man for providing below solution. 1. Traverse the first linked list(count the elements) and make a circular linked list. (Remember the last node so that we can break the circle later on). 2. Now view the problem as finding the loop in the second linked list. So the problem is solved. 3. Since we already know the length of the loop(size of the first linked list) we can traverse those many numbers of nodes in the second list, and then start another pointer from the beginning of the second list. we have to traverse until they are equal, and that is the required intersection point. 4. remove the circle from the linked list.Time Complexity: O(m+n) Auxiliary Space: O(1)Method 5 (Reverse the first list and make equations) Thanks to Saravanan Mani for providing this method.Advantage: No Comparison of pointers. Disadvantage: Modifying linked list(Reversing list). Time complexity: O(m+n) Auxiliary Space: O(1)Method 6 (Traverse both lists and compare addresses of last nodes) This method is only to detect if there is an intersection point or not. (Thanks to NeoTheSaviour for suggesting this)The time complexity of this method is O(m+n) and used Auxiliary space is O(1)Method 7 (Use Hashing) Basically, we need to find a common node of two linked lists. So we hash all nodes of the first list and then check the second list. 1) Create an empty hash set. 2) Traverse the first linked list and insert all nodes’ addresses in the hash set. 3) Traverse the second list. For every node check if it is present in the hash set. If we find a node in the hash set, return the node.This method required O(n) additional space and not very efficient if one list is large.Method 8( 2-pointer technique ):Using Two pointers :Time complexity : O( m + n ) Auxiliary Space:  O(1)Please write comments if you find any bug in the above algorithm or a better way to solve the same problem.Writing code in comment?\n",

The second pointer however CAN point to any node in the list and not just the previous node. Now write a program in O(n) time to duplicate this list.

And finally restores the original list.1) Create all nodes in copy linked list using next pointers. 2) Store the node and its next pointer mappings of original linked list. 3) Change next pointer of all nodes in original linked list to point to the corresponding node in copy linked list. Following diagram shows status of both Linked Lists after above 3 steps. The red arrow shows arbit pointers and black arrow shows next pointers.Figure 24) Change the arbit pointer of all nodes in copy linked list to point to corresponding node in original linked list. 5) Now construct the arbit pointer in copy linked list as below and restore the next pointer of nodes in the original linked list.6) Restore the next pointers in original linked list from the stored mappings(in step 2).Time Complexity:  O(n) Auxiliary Space:  O(n)Method 2 (Uses Constant Extra Space) Thanks to Saravanan Mani for providing this solution. This solution works using constant space. 1) Create the copy of node 1 and insert it between node 1 & node 2 in original Linked List, create the copy of 2 and insert it between 2 & 3.. Continue in this fashion, add the copy of N after the Nth node 2) Now copy the arbitrary link in this fashionThis works because original->next is nothing but copy of original and Original->arbitrary->next is nothing but copy of arbitrary. 3) Now restore the original and copy linked lists in this fashion in a single loop.4) Make sure that last element of original->next is NULL.Refer below post for implementation of this method. Clone a linked list with next and random pointer in O(1) spaceTime Complexity: O(n) Auxiliary Space: O(1)Refer Following Post for Hashing based Implementation. Clone a linked list with next and random pointer | Set 2Asked by Varun Bhatia.

      " Find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous bars. For simplicity, assume that all bars have same width and the width is 1 unit. For example, consider the following histogram with 7 bars of heights {6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6}. The largest possible rectangle possible is 12 (see the below figure, the max area rectangle is highlighted in red)We have discussed a Divide and Conquer based O(nLogn) solution for this problem. In this post, O(n) time solution is discussed. Like the previous post, width of all bars is assumed to be 1 for simplicity. For every bar ‘x’, we calculate the area with ‘x’ as the smallest bar in the rectangle. If we calculate such area for every bar ‘x’ and find the maximum of all areas, our task is done. How to calculate area with ‘x’ as smallest bar? We need to know index of the first smaller (smaller than ‘x’) bar on left of ‘x’ and index of first smaller bar on right of ‘x’. Let us call these indexes as ‘left index’ and ‘right index’ respectively. We traverse all bars from left to right, maintain a stack of bars. Every bar is pushed to stack once. A bar is popped from stack when a bar of smaller height is seen. When a bar is popped, we calculate the area with the popped bar as smallest bar. How do we get left and right indexes of the popped bar – the current index tells us the ‘right index’ and index of previous item in stack is the ‘left index’. Following is the complete algorithm.1) Create an empty stack.2) Start from first bar, and do following for every bar ‘hist[i]’ where ‘i’ varies from 0 to n-1. ……a) If stack is empty or hist[i] is higher than the bar at top of stack, then push ‘i’ to stack. ……b) If this bar is smaller than the top of stack, then keep removing the top of stack while top of the stack is greater. Let the removed bar be hist[tp]. Calculate area of rectangle with hist[tp] as smallest bar. For hist[tp], the ‘left index’ is previous (previous to tp) item in stack and ‘right index’ is ‘i’ (current index).3) If the stack is not empty, then one by one remove all bars from stack and do step 2.b for every removed bar.Following is implementation of the above algorithm.Time Complexity: Since every bar is pushed and popped only once, the time complexity of this method is O(n).Another Efficient Approach :  By finding next smaller element and previous smaller element for every element in O(n) time complexity and O(n) auxiliary space .Step 1 : First we will take two arrays left_smaller[] and right_smaller[] and initialize it with -1 and n respectively.Step 2 : For every element we will store the index of previous smaller and next smaller element in left_smaller[] and right_smaller[] arrays respectively.(It will take O(n) time).Step 3 : Now for every element we will calculate area by taking this ith element as the smallest in the range left_smaller[i] and right_smaller[i] and multiplying it with the difference of left_smaller[i] and right_smaller[i].Step 4 : We can find the maximum of all the area calculated in step 3 to get the desired maximum area.Time Complexity :  O(n)Space Complexity :  O(n)References http://www.informatik.uni-ulm.de/acm/Locals/2003/html/histogram.html http://www.informatik.uni-ulm.de/acm/Locals/2003/html/judge.htmlThanks to Ashish Anand for suggesting initial solution.

      " The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of n daily price quotes for a stock and we need to calculate span of stock’s price for all n days. The span Si of the stock’s price on a given day i is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days just before the given day, for which the price of the stock on the current day is less than its price on the given day. For example, if an array of 7 days prices is given as {100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85}, then the span values for corresponding 7 days are {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6}A Simple but inefficient method Traverse the input price array. For every element being visited, traverse elements on the left of it and increment the span value of it while elements on the left side are smaller.Following is the implementation of this method:The Time Complexity of the above method is O(n^2). We can calculate stock span values in O(n) time.A Linear-Time Complexity Method We see that S[i] on the day i can be easily computed if we know the closest day preceding i, such that the price is greater than on that day than the price on the day i. If such a day exists, let’s call it h(i), otherwise, we define h(i) = -1. The span is now computed as S[i] = i – h(i). See the following diagram.To implement this logic, we use a stack as an abstract data type to store the days i, h(i), h(h(i)), and so on. When we go from day i-1 to i, we pop the days when the price of the stock was less than or equal to price[i] and then push the value of day i back into the stack.Following is the implementation of this method.We have to check also for a case when all the stock prices should be the same so therefore we have to just check whether the current stock price is bigger than the previous one or not . We will not pop from the stack when the current and previous stock prices are the same.Time Complexity: O(n). It seems more than O(n) at first look. If we take a closer look, we can observe that every element of the array is added and removed from the stack at most once. So there are total 2n operations at most. Assuming that a stack operation takes O(1) time, we can say that the time complexity is O(n).Auxiliary Space: O(n) in the worst case when all elements are sorted in decreasing order.Another approach: (without using stack)A Stack Based approach :Below is the implementation of the above approach:which was the same expected output.Writing code in comment?\n",

Find the stranger (celebrity) in the minimum number of questions.We can describe the problem input as an array of numbers/characters representing persons in the party. We also have a hypothetical function HaveAcquaintance(A, B) which returns true if A knows B, false otherwise. How can we solve the problem.Examples:We measure the complexity in terms of calls made to HaveAcquaintance().Method 1: This uses Graph to arrive at the particular solution.Approach: Model the solution using graphs. Initialize indegree and outdegree of every vertex as 0. If A knows B, draw a directed edge from A to B, increase indegree of B and outdegree of A by 1. Construct all possible edges of the graph for every possible pair [i, j]. There are NC2 pairs. If a celebrity is present in the party, there will be one sink node in the graph with outdegree of zero and indegree of N-1.Algorithm:Implementation:Output :Complexity Analysis:Approach : The problem can be solved using recursion. Say, if the ‘potential celebrity’ of N-1 persons is known, can the solution to N be found from it? A potential celebrity is one who is the only one left after eliminating n-1 people. n-1 people are eliminated with the following strategy:The above-mentioned approach use Recursion to find the potential celebrity among n persons, recursively calls n-1 persons, till the base case of 0 persons is reached. For 0 persons -1 is returned indicating that there are no possible celebrities since there are 0 people. In the ith stage of recursion, the ith person and (i-1)th person are compared to check if anyone of them knows the other. And using the above logic (in the bullet points) the potential celebrity is returned to the (i+1)th stage.Once the recursive function returns an id. We check if this id does not know anybody else, but all others know this id. If this is true, then this id will be the celebrity.Algorithm :Implementation:Output :Complexity Analysis:Approach: There are some observations based on elimination technique (Refer Polya’s How to Solve It book).Algorithm:Implementation:Output :Complexity Analysis:Optimal Approach: The idea is to use two pointers, one from start and one from the end. Assume the start person is A, and the end person is B. If A knows B, then A must not be the celebrity. Else, B must not be the celebrity. At the end of the loop, only one index will be left as a celebrity. Go through each person again and check whether this is the celebrity. The Two Pointer approach can be used where two pointers can be assigned, one at the start and the other at the end, and the elements can be compared and the search space can be reduced.Algorithm :Implementation:Output :Complexity Analysis:Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Given a string consisting of opening and closing parenthesis, find the length of the longest valid parenthesis substring.Examples:A Simple Approach is to find all the substrings of given string. For every string, check if it is a valid string or not. If valid and length is more than maximum length so far, then update maximum length. We can check whether a substring is valid or not in linear time using a stack (See this for details). Time complexity of this solution is O(n2.An Efficient Solution can solve this problem in O(n) time. The idea is to store indexes of previous starting brackets in a stack. The first element of the stack is a special element that provides index before the beginning of valid substring (base for next valid string).Below is the implementation of the above algorithm.Explanation with example:Another Efficient Approach can solve the problem in O(n) time. The idea is to maintain an array that stores the length of the longest valid substring ending at that index. We iterate through the array and return the maximum value.Below is the implementations of the above algorithm.Thanks to Gaurav Ahirwar and Ekta Goel for suggesting above approach.Another approach in O(1) auxiliary space and O(N) Time complexity:Below is the implementation of the above approach:Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Given an integer array of size n, find the maximum of the minimum’s of every window size in the array. Note that window size varies from 1 to n.Example:Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 50, 10, 70, 30} Output: 70, 30, 20, 10, 10, 10, 10The first element in the output indicates the maximum of minimums of all windows of size 1. Minimums of windows of size 1 are {10}, {20}, {30}, {50}, {10}, {70} and {30}. Maximum of these minimums is 70The second element in the output indicates the maximum of minimums of all windows of size 2. Minimums of windows of size 2 are {10}, {20}, {30}, {10}, {10}, and {30}. Maximum of these minimums is 30The third element in the output indicates the maximum of minimums of all windows of size 3. Minimums of windows of size 3 are {10}, {20}, {10}, {10} and {10}. Maximum of these minimums is 20Similarly, other elements of output are computed.Naive Solution: Brute Force. Approach: A simple brute force approach to solve this problem can be to generate all the windows possible of a particular length say ‘L’ and find the minimum element in all such windows. Then find the maximum of all such elements and store it. Now the length of window is 1<=L<=N. So we have to generate all possible windows of size ‘1’ to ‘N’ and for generating each such window we have to mark the end-points of that window. So for that, we have to use a nested loop for fixing the starting and end point of the window respectively. Therefore there will be a use of triple-nested loop in brute-force approach mainly for fixing the length of the window, starting point and end point.Output:Complexity Analysis:Efficient Solution: We can solve this problem in O(n) time. The idea is to use extra space. Below are detailed steps.Step 1: Find indexes of next smaller and previous smaller for every element. Next smaller is the nearest smallest element on right side of arr[i]. Similarly, a previous smaller element is the nearest smallest element on the left side of arr[i]. If there is no smaller element on the right side, then the next smaller is n. If there is no smaller on the left side, then the previous smaller is -1.For input {10, 20, 30, 50, 10, 70, 30}, array of indexes of next smaller is {7, 4, 4, 4, 7, 6, 7}. For input {10, 20, 30, 50, 10, 70, 30}, array of indexes of previous smaller is {-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, 4, 4}This step can be done in O(n) time using the approach discussed in next greater element.Step 2: Once we have indexes of next and previous smaller, we know that arr[i] is a minimum of a window of length “right[i] – left[i] – 1”. Lengths of windows for which the elements are minimum are {7, 3, 2, 1, 7, 1, 2}. This array indicates, the first element is minimum in the window of size 7, the second element is minimum in the window of size 3, and so on.Create an auxiliary array ans[n+1] to store the result. Values in ans[] can be filled by iterating through right[] and left[]We get the ans[] array as {0, 70, 30, 20, 0, 0, 0, 10}. Note that ans[0] or answer for length 0 is useless.Step 3: Some entries in ans[] are 0 and yet to be filled. For example, we know maximum of minimum for lengths 1, 2, 3 and 7 are 70, 30, 20 and 10 respectively, but we don’t know the same for lengths 4, 5 and 6. Below are few important observations to fill remaining entries a) Result for length i, i.e. ans[i] would always be greater or same as result for length i+1, i.e., ans[i+1]. b) If ans[i] is not filled it means there is no direct element which is minimum of length i and therefore either the element of length ans[i+1], or ans[i+2], and so on is same as ans[i] So we fill rest of the entries using below loop.Below is implementation of above algorithm.Output:Complexity Analysis:This article is contributed by Ekta Goel and Ayush Govil.

      " Given an array and an integer K, find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size k.Examples :Method 1: This is a simple method to solve the above problem.Approach: The idea is very basic run a nested loop, the outer loop which will mark the starting point of the subarray of length k, the inner loop will run from the starting index to index+k, k elements from starting index and print the maximum element among these k elements.Algorithm:Implementation:Complexity Analysis:Method 2: This method uses the Self-Balancing BST to solve the given problem.Approach: To find maximum among k elements of the subarray the previous method uses a loop traversing through the elements. To reduce that time the idea is to use an AVL tree which returns the maximum element in log n time. So, traverse through the array and keep k elements in the BST and print the maximum in every iteration. AVL tree is a suitable data structure as lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation.Algorithm:Implementation:Complexity Analysis:Method 3: This method uses Deque to solve the above problemApproach: Create a Deque, Qi of capacity k, that stores only useful elements of current window of k elements. An element is useful if it is in current window and is greater than all other elements on right side of it in current window. Process all array elements one by one and maintain Qi to contain useful elements of current window and these useful elements are maintained in sorted order. The element at front of the Qi is the largest and element at rear/back of Qi is the smallest of current window. Thanks to Aashish for suggesting this method.Dry run of the above approach:Algorithm:Implementation:Complexity Analysis:Below is an extension of this problem: Sum of minimum and maximum elements of all subarrays of size k.Method 4: This method is modification in queue implementation of two stack:Algorithm :ImplementationComplexity Analysis:Method 5: This method uses Max-Heap to solve the above problem.Approach: In the above-mentioned methods, one of them was using AVL tree. This approach is very similar to that approach. The difference is that instead of using the AVL tree, Max-Heap will be used in this approach. The elements of the current window will be stored in the Max-Heap and the maximum element or the root will be printed in each iteration. Max-heap is a suitable data structure as it provides constant-time retrieval and logarithmic time removal of both the minimum and maximum elements in it, i.e. it takes constant time to find the maximum element, and insertion and deletion takes log n time.Algorithm:Writing code in comment?\n",

      " There are given n ropes of different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one rope. The cost to connect two ropes is equal to the sum of their lengths. We need to connect the ropes with minimum cost.For example, if we are given 4 ropes of lengths 4, 3, 2, and 6. We can connect the ropes in the following ways. 1) First, connect ropes of lengths 2 and 3. Now we have three ropes of lengths 4, 6, and 5. 2) Now connect ropes of lengths 4 and 5. Now we have two ropes of lengths 6 and 9. 3) Finally connect the two ropes and all ropes have connected.Total cost for connecting all ropes is 5 + 9 + 15 = 29. This is the optimized cost for connecting ropes. Other ways of connecting ropes would always have same or more cost. For example, if we connect 4 and 6 first (we get three strings of 3, 2, and 10), then connect 10 and 3 (we get two strings of 13 and 2). Finally, we connect 13 and 2. Total cost in this way is 10 + 13 + 15 = 38.Solution: If we observe the above problem closely, we can notice that the lengths of the ropes which are picked first are included more than once in total cost. Therefore, the idea is to connect the smallest two ropes first and recur for the remaining ropes. This approach is similar to Huffman Coding. We put the smallest ropes down the tree so that they can be repeated multiple times rather than the longer ropes.So it forms a structure like a tree:The sum contains sum of depth of each value. For array (2, 3, 4, 6) the sum is equal to 2 * 3 + 3 * 3 + 4 * 2 + 6 * 1 = 29 (According to the diagram).Algorithm:Following is the implementation of the above algorithm.Output:Complexity Analysis:Algorithmic Paradigm: Greedy AlgorithmA simple implementation with STL in C++ This uses priority_queue available in STL.

      " Given that integers are being read from a data stream. Find the median of all the elements read so far starting from the first integer till the last integer. This is also called the Median of Running Integers. The data stream can be any source of data, for example, a file, an array of integers, input stream etc.What is Median?Median can be defined as the element in the data set which separates the higher half of the data sample from the lower half. In other words, we can get the median element as, when the input size is odd, we take the middle element of sorted data. If the input size is even, we pick an average of middle two elements in the sorted stream.Examples:Input: 5 10 15 Output: 5, 7.5, 10 Explanation: Given the input stream as an array of integers [5,10,15]. Read integers one by one and print the median correspondingly. So, after reading first element 5,median is 5. After reading 10,median is 7.5 After reading 15 ,median is 10.Input: 1, 2, 3, 4 Output: 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 Explanation: Given the input stream as an array of integers [1, 2, 3, 4].

After reading 2,median is 1.5 After reading 3 ,median is 2.After reading 4 ,median is 2.5.Approach: The idea is to use max heap and min heap to store the elements of higher half and lower half.

After the first merge, we have k/2 arrays. Again merge arrays in groups, now we have k/4 arrays. This is similar to merge sort. Divide k arrays into two halves containing an equal number of arrays until there are two arrays in a group. This is followed by merging the arrays in a bottom-up manner.Complexity Analysis:Alternative Efficient Approach: The idea is to use Min Heap. This MinHeap based solution has the same time complexity which is O(NK log K). But for a different and particular sized array, this solution works much better. The process must start with creating a MinHeap and inserting the first element of all the k arrays. Remove the root element of Minheap and put it in the output array and insert the next element from the array of removed element. To get the result the step must continue until there is no element in the MinHeap left.MinHeap: A Min-Heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is smaller than or equal to the values in the children of that node. Mapping the elements of a heap into an array is trivial: if a node is stored at index k, then its left child is stored at index 2k + 1 and its right child at index 2k + 2.Implementation:Complexity Analysis:Merge k sorted arrays | Set 2 (Different Sized Arrays)Thanks to vignesh for suggesting this problem and initial solution.

      " Suppose there is a circle. There are n petrol pumps on that circle. You are given two sets of data.Calculate the first point from where a truck will be able to complete the circle (The truck will stop at each petrol pump and it has infinite capacity). Expected time complexity is O(n). Assume for 1-litre petrol, the truck can go 1 unit of distance.For example, let there be 4 petrol pumps with amount of petrol and distance to next petrol pump value pairs as {4, 6}, {6, 5}, {7, 3} and {4, 5}. The first point from where the truck can make a circular tour is 2nd petrol pump. Output should be “start = 1” (index of 2nd petrol pump).A Simple Solution is to consider every petrol pumps as a starting point and see if there is a possible tour. If we find a starting point with a feasible solution, we return that starting point. The worst case time complexity of this solution is O(n^2).An efficient approach is to use a Queue to store the current tour. We first enqueue first petrol pump to the queue, we keep enqueueing petrol pumps till we either complete the tour, or the current amount of petrol becomes negative. If the amount becomes negative, then we keep dequeuing petrol pumps until the queue becomes empty.Instead of creating a separate queue, we use the given array itself as a queue. We maintain two index variables start and end that represent the rear and front of the queue.Below image is a dry run of the above approach:Below is the implementation of the above approach:Time Complexity: We are visiting each petrol pump exactly once, therefore the time complexity is O(n)Auxiliary Space: O(1)Another efficient solution can be to find out the first petrol pump where the amount of petrol is greater than or equal to the distance to be covered to reach the next petrol pump. Now we mark that petrol pump as start and now we check whether we can finish the journey towards the end point. If in the middle, at any petrol pump, the amount of petrol is less than the distance to be covered to reach the next petrol pump, then we can say we cannot complete the circular tour from start. We again try to find out the next point from where we can start our journey i.e. the next petrol pump where the amount of petrol is greater than or equal to the distance to be covered and we mark it as start. We need not look at any petrol pump in between the initial petrol pump marked as start and the new start as we know that we cannot complete the journey if we start from any middle petrol pump because eventually we will arrive at a point where amount of petrol is less than the distance. Now we repeat the process until we reach the last petrol pump and update our start as and when required. After we reach our last petrol pump, we try to reach our first petrol pump from the last and let’s say we have a remaining amount of petrol as curr_petrol. Now we again start traveling from the first petrol pump and take the advantage of our curr_petrol and try to reach the start. If we can reach the start, then we may conclude that start can be our starting point.Below is the implementation of the above approach:Time Complexity: O(n)Auxiliary Space: O(1)Another simpler approach is to store the value of the capacity in some variable whenever the capacity becomes less than zero.In this case You have to traverse the array only once as compared to previous method which traverses the each index twice.Here is the implementation of above idea:-Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed aboveWriting code in comment?\n",

      " A tree where no leaf is much farther away from the root than any other leaf. Different balancing schemes allow different definitions of “much farther” and different amounts of work to keep them balanced.Consider a height-balancing scheme where following conditions should be checked to determine if a binary tree is balanced. An empty tree is height-balanced. A non-empty binary tree T is balanced if: 1) Left subtree of T is balanced 2) Right subtree of T is balanced 3) The difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree is not more than 1. The above height-balancing scheme is used in AVL trees. The diagram below shows two trees, one of them is height-balanced and other is not. The second tree is not height-balanced because height of left subtree is 2 more than height of right subtree.To check if a tree is height-balanced, get the height of left and right subtrees. Return true if difference between heights is not more than 1 and left and right subtrees are balanced, otherwise return false.Output:Time Complexity: O(n^2) in case of full binary tree.Optimized implementation: Above implementation can be optimized by calculating the height in the same recursion rather than calling a height() function separately. Thanks to Amar for suggesting this optimized version.

      " Write a function to print ZigZag order traversal of a binary tree. For the below binary tree the zigzag order traversal will be 1 3 2 7 6 5 4.This problem can be solved using two stacks. Assume the two stacks are current: currentlevel and nextlevel. We would also need a variable to keep track of the current level order(whether it is left to right or right to left). We pop from the currentlevel stack and print the nodes value. Whenever the current level order is from left to right, push the nodes left child, then its right child to the stack nextlevel. Since a stack is a LIFO(Last-In-First_out) structure, next time when nodes are popped off nextlevel, it will be in the reverse order. On the other hand, when the current level order is from right to left, we would push the nodes right child first, then its left child. Finally, do-not forget to swap those two stacks at the end of each level(i.e., when current level is empty) Below is the implementation of the above approach:Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(n)+(n)=O(n)Recursive Approach:The approach used here is the observable similarity to the level order traversal. Here we need to include an extra parameter to keep a track of printing each level in left-right or right-left way.Output:ZigZag traversal of binary tree is:1 3 2 4 5 6 7 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8Another Approach:In this approach, use a deque to solve the problem. Push and pop in different ways depending on if the level is odd or level is even.Below is the implementation of the above approach:Time Complexity: O(N)Auxiliary Space: O(N) for deque data structureAnother Approach:We can use a queue just like we used in Level Order Traversal. But in this case, we can also maintain a flag variable which keeps track of alternate level to reverse the order of the corresponding level traversal.flag==true implies we have to insert from left to right and flag==false means we have to insert element from right to left our answer arraylist.Time Complexity: O(N)Auxiliary Space: O(N) for queue data structureBelow is a simple implementation of this problem.

      " Given a Binary Tree, write an iterative function to print the Preorder traversal of the given binary tree.Refer to this for recursive preorder traversal of Binary Tree. To convert an inherently recursive procedure to iterative, we need an explicit stack. Following is a simple stack based iterative process to print Preorder traversal. 1) Create an empty stack nodeStack and push root node to stack. 2) Do the following while nodeStack is not empty. ….a) Pop an item from the stack and print it. ….b) Push right child of a popped item to stack ….c) Push left child of a popped item to stackThe right child is pushed before the left child to make sure that the left subtree is processed first.Time Complexity: O(N) Auxiliary Space: O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the tree.Space Optimized Solution: The idea is to start traversing the tree from the root node, and keep printing the left child while exists and simultaneously, push the right child of every node in an auxiliary stack.

For the tree shown above, minimum distance is -2 (for node with value 4) and maximum distance is 3 (For node with value 9). Once we have maximum and minimum distances from root, we iterate for each vertical line at distance minimum to maximum from root, and for each vertical line traverse the tree and print the nodes which lie on that vertical line.Algorithm:Implementation: Following is the implementation of above algorithm.Output:Time Complexity: Time complexity of above algorithm is O(w*n) where w is width of Binary Tree and n is number of nodes in Binary Tree.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.For example, minimum height of below Binary Tree is 2.Note that the path must end on a leaf node. For example, the minimum height of below Binary Tree is also 2.The idea is to traverse the given Binary Tree. For every node, check if it is a leaf node. If yes, then return 1. If not leaf node then if the left subtree is NULL, then recur for the right subtree. And if the right subtree is NULL, then recur for the left subtree.

      " Given a binary tree, print boundary nodes of the binary tree Anti-Clockwise starting from the root. The boundary includes left boundary, leaves, and right boundary in order without duplicate nodes. (The values of the nodes may still be duplicates.)The left boundary is defined as the path from the root to the left-most node. The right boundary is defined as the path from the root to the right-most node. If the root doesn’t have left subtree or right subtree, then the root itself is left boundary or right boundary. Note this definition only applies to the input binary tree, and not apply to any subtrees.The left-most node is defined as a leaf node you could reach when you always firstly travel to the left subtree if it exists. If not, travel to the right subtree. Repeat until you reach a leaf node.The right-most node is also defined in the same way with left and right exchanged. For example, boundary traversal of the following tree is “20 8 4 10 14 25 22”We break the problem in 3 parts: 1. Print the left boundary in top-down manner. 2. Print all leaf nodes from left to right, which can again be sub-divided into two sub-parts: …..2.1 Print all leaf nodes of left sub-tree from left to right. …..2.2 Print all leaf nodes of right subtree from left to right. 3.

      " Write a function to connect all the adjacent nodes at the same level in a binary tree. Structure of the given Binary Tree node is like following.Initially, all the nextRight pointers point to garbage values. Your function should set these pointers to point next right for each node.Example:Method 1 (Extend Level Order Traversal or BFS) Consider the method 2 of Level Order Traversal. The method 2 can easily be extended to connect nodes of same level. We can augment queue entries to contain level of nodes also which is 0 for root, 1 for root’s children and so on. So a queue node will now contain a pointer to a tree node and an integer level. When we enqueue a node, we make sure that correct level value for node is being set in queue. To set nextRight, for every node N, we dequeue the next node from queue, if the level number of next node is same, we set the nextRight of N as address of the dequeued node, otherwise we set nextRight of N as NULL. We initialize a node Prev which points at the previous node. While traversing the nodes in the same level we keep track of the previous node and point the nextRight pointer to the current node in every iteration.Please refer connect Nodes at same Level (Level Order Traversal) for implementation.Time Complexity: O(n)Method 2 (Extend Pre Order Traversal) This approach works only for Complete Binary Trees. In this method we set nextRight in Pre Order fashion to make sure that the nextRight of parent is set before its children. When we are at node p, we set the nextRight of its left and right children. Since the tree is complete tree, nextRight of p’s left child (p->left->nextRight) will always be p’s right child, and nextRight of p’s right child (p->right->nextRight) will always be left child of p’s nextRight (if p is not the rightmost node at its level). If p is the rightmost node, then nextRight of p’s right child will be NULL.Thanks to Dhanya for suggesting this approach.Time Complexity: O(n)Why doesn’t method 2 work for trees which are not Complete Binary Trees? Let us consider following tree as an example. In Method 2, we set the nextRight pointer in pre order fashion. When we are at node 4, we set the nextRight of its children which are 8 and 9 (the nextRight of 4 is already set as node 5). nextRight of 8 will simply be set as 9, but nextRight of 9 will be set as NULL which is incorrect. We can’t set the correct nextRight, because when we set nextRight of 9, we only have nextRight of node 4 and ancestors of node 4, we don’t have nextRight of nodes in right subtree of root.See Connect nodes at same level using constant extra space for more solutions.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Given a binary tree (not a binary search tree) and two values say n1 and n2, write a program to find the least common ancestor.Following is definition of LCA from Wikipedia: Let T be a rooted tree. The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).The LCA of n1 and n2 in T is the shared ancestor of n1 and n2 that is located farthest from the root. Computation of lowest common ancestors may be useful, for instance, as part of a procedure for determining the distance between pairs of nodes in a tree: the distance from n1 to n2 can be computed as the distance from the root to n1, plus the distance from the root to n2, minus twice the distance from the root to their lowest common ancestor. (Source Wiki)We have discussed an efficient solution to find LCA in Binary Search Tree. In Binary Search Tree, using BST properties, we can find LCA in O(h) time where h is the height of the tree. Such an implementation is not possible in Binary Tree as keys Binary Tree nodes don’t follow any order. The following are different approaches to find LCA in Binary Tree.Method 1 (By Storing root to n1 and root to n2 paths): Following is a simple O(n) algorithm to find LCA of n1 and n2. 1) Find a path from the root to n1 and store it in a vector or array. 2) Find a path from the root to n2 and store it in another vector or array. 3) Traverse both paths till the values in arrays are the same. Return the common element just before the mismatch.Following is the implementation of the above algorithm.Output:Time Complexity: The time complexity of the above solution is O(n). The tree is traversed twice, and then path arrays are compared. Thanks to Ravi Chandra Enaganti for suggesting the initial solution based on this method.Method 2 (Using Single Traversal) Method 1 finds LCA in O(n) time but requires three tree traversals plus extra spaces for path arrays. If we assume that the keys n1 and n2 are present in Binary Tree, we can find LCA using a single traversal of Binary Tree and without extra storage for path arrays. The idea is to traverse the tree starting from the root. If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with the root, then the root is LCA (assuming that both keys are present). If the root doesn’t match with any of the keys, we recur for the left and right subtree. The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the other key present in the right subtree is the LCA. If both keys lie in the left subtree, then the left subtree has LCA also, otherwise, LCA lies in the right subtree.Output:Thanks to Atul Singh for suggesting this solution.Time Complexity: The time complexity of the above solution is O(n) as the method does a simple tree traversal in a bottom-up fashion.Note that the above method assumes that keys are present in Binary Tree. If one key is present and the other is absent, then it returns the present key as LCA (Ideally should have returned NULL).We can extend this method to handle all cases bypassing two boolean variables v1 and v2. v1 is set as true when n1 is present in the tree and v2 is set as true if n2 is present in the tree.Output:Thanks to Dhruv for suggesting this extended solution. You may like to see the below articles as well : LCA using Parent PointerLowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Search Tree.Find LCA in Binary Tree using RMQPlease write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed aboveWriting code in comment?\n",

      " Let us consider the below traversals:Inorder sequence: D B E A F C Preorder sequence: A B D E C FIn a Preorder sequence, the leftmost element is the root of the tree. So we know ‘A’ is the root for given sequences. By searching ‘A’ in the Inorder sequence, we can find out all elements on the left side of ‘A’ is in the left subtree, and elements on right in the right subtree. So we know the below structure now.We recursively follow the above steps and get the following tree.Algorithm: buildTree() 1) Pick an element from Preorder. Increment a Preorder Index Variable (preIndex in below code) to pick the next element in the next recursive call. 2) Create a new tree node tNode with the data as the picked element. 3) Find the picked element’s index in Inorder. Let the index be inIndex. 4) Call buildTree for elements before inIndex and make the built tree as a left subtree of tNode. 5) Call buildTree for elements after inIndex and make the built tree as a right subtree of tNode. 6) return tNode.Time Complexity: O(n^2). The worst case occurs when the tree is left-skewed. Example Preorder and Inorder traversals for worst-case are {A, B, C, D} and {D, C, B, A}.Efficient Approach : We can optimize the above solution using hashing (unordered_map in C++ or HashMap in Java). We store indexes of inorder traversal in a hash table. So that search can be done O(1) time.Time Complexity : O(n) Another approach : Use the fact that InOrder traversal is Left-Root-Right and PreOrder traversal is Root-Left-Right. Also, the first node in the PreOrder traversal is always the root node and the first node in the InOrder traversal is the leftmost node in the tree.Maintain two data structures: Stack (to store the path we visited while traversing PreOrder array) and Set (to maintain the node in which the next right subtree is expected).1. Do below until you reach the leftmost node. Keep creating the nodes from the PreOrder traversal If the stack’s topmost element is not in the set, link the created node to the left child of the stack’s topmost element (if any), without popping the element. Else link the created node to the right child of the stack’s topmost element. Remove the stack’s topmost element from the set and the stack. Push the node to a stack.2. Keep popping the nodes from the stack until either the stack is empty, or the topmost element of the stack compares to the current element of InOrder traversal. Once the loop is over, push the last node back into the stack and into the set.3. Goto Step 1.Construct a Binary Tree from Postorder and InorderWriting code in comment?\n",

Expected time complexity is O(n).If one side of root is empty, then function should return minus infinite (INT_MIN in case of C/C++)A simple solution is to traverse the tree and do following for every traversed node X. 1) Find maximum sum from leaf to root in left subtree of X (we can use this post for this and next steps) 2) Find maximum sum from leaf to root in right subtree of X. 3) Add the above two calculated values and X->data and compare the sum with the maximum value obtained so far and update the maximum value. 4) Return the maximum value.The time complexity of above solution is O(n2)We can find the maximum sum using single traversal of binary tree. The idea is to maintain two values in recursive calls(Note: If the tree is right-most or left-most tree then first we have to adjust the tree such that both the right and left are not null. Left-most means if the right of super root of the tree is null and right-most tree means if left of  super root of the tree is null.)1) Maximum root to leaf path sum for the subtree rooted under current node. 2) The maximum path sum between leaves (desired output).For every visited node X, we find the maximum root to leaf sum in left and right subtrees of X. We add the two values with X->data, and compare the sum with maximum path sum found so far.Following is the implementation of the above O(n) solution.Thanks to Saurabh Vats for suggesting corrections in the original approach.This article is contributed by Kripal Gaurav.

The task is to minimize the difference between the heights of the longest and the shortest tower after modifications and output this difference.Examples:Input  : arr[] = {1, 15, 10}, k = 6Output :  Maximum difference is 5.Explanation : We change 1 to 7, 15 to 9 and 10 to 4. Maximum difference is 5 (between 4 and 9). We can’t get a lower difference.Input : arr[] = {1, 5, 15, 10}           k = 3   Output : Maximum difference is 8 arr[] = {4, 8, 12, 7}Input : arr[] = {4, 6}          k = 10Output : Maximum difference is 2 arr[] = {14, 16} OR {-6, -4}Input : arr[] = {6, 10}         k = 3Output : Maximum difference is 2 arr[] = {9, 7}Input : arr[] = {1, 10, 14, 14, 14, 15}        k = 6 Output: Maximum difference is 5 arr[] = {7, 4, 8, 8, 8, 9}Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3}        k = 2 Output: Maximum difference is 2 arr[] = {3, 4, 5}Source: Adobe Interview Experience | Set 24 (On-Campus for MTS)First, we try to sort the array and make each height of the tower maximum. We do this by decreasing the height of all the towers towards the right by k and increasing all the height of the towers towards the left (by k). It is also possible that the tower you are trying to increase the height doesn’t have the maximum height. Therefore we only need to check whether it has the maximum height or not by comparing it with the last element on the right side which is a[n]-k. Since the array is sorted if the tower’s height is greater than the [n]-k then it’s the tallest tower available. Similar reasoning can also be applied to finding the shortest tower.  Note:- We need not consider where a[i]<k because the height of the tower can’t be negative so we have to neglect that case.Below is the implementation of the above approach:Time Complexity: O(nlogn)Auxiliary Space: O(n)Writing code in comment?\n",

      " How to find the largest number with given digit sum s and number of digits d?Examples:A Simple Solution is to consider all m digit numbers and keep track of maximum number with digit sum as s. A close upper bound on time complexity of this solution is O(10m).There is a Greedy approach to solve the problem. The idea is to one by one fill all digits from leftmost to rightmost (or from most significant digit to least significant). We compare the remaining sum with 9 if the remaining sum is more than 9, we put 9 at the current position, else we put the remaining sum. Since we fill digits from left to right, we put the highest digits on the left side, hence get the largest number. Below image is an illustration of the above approach:Below is the implementation of the above approach:Output :Time Complexity of this solution is O(m).This article is contributed by Vaibhav Agarwal.

      " Given the weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.In the 0-1 Knapsack problem, we are not allowed to break items. We either take the whole item or don’t take it.Input: Items as (value, weight) pairs arr[] = {{60, 10}, {100, 20}, {120, 30}} Knapsack Capacity, W = 50;Output: Maximum possible value = 240 by taking items of weight 10 and 20 kg and 2/3 fraction of 30 kg. Hence total price will be 60+100+(2/3)(120) = 240In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack. This problem in which we can break an item is also called the fractional knapsack problem.A brute-force solution would be to try all possible subset with all different fraction but that will be too much time taking.An efficient solution is to use the Greedy approach. The basic idea of the greedy approach is to calculate the ratio value/weight for each item and sort the item on basis of this ratio. Then take the item with the highest ratio and add them until we can’t add the next item as a whole and at the end add the next item as much as we can. Which will always be the optimal solution to this problem.A simple code with our own comparison function can be written as follows, please see the sort function more closely, the third argument to sort function is our comparison function which sorts the item according to value/weight ratio in non-decreasing order. After sorting we need to loop over these items and add them in our knapsack satisfying above-mentioned criteria.Below is the implementation of the above idea:As main time taking step is sorting, the whole problem can be solved in O(n log n) only. This article is contributed by Utkarsh Trivedi.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Given an array of size n that has the following specifications:We need to find the maximum number of thieves that can be caught.Examples:A brute force approach would be to check all feasible sets of combinations of police and thief and return the maximum size set among them. Its time complexity is exponential and it can be optimized if we observe an important property. An efficient solution is to use a greedy algorithm. But which greedy property to use can be tricky. We can try using: “For each policeman from the left catch the nearest possible thief.” This works for example three given above but fails for example two as it outputs 2 which is incorrect. We may also try: “For each policeman from the left catch the farthest possible thief”. This works for example two given above but fails for example three as it outputs 2 which is incorrect. A symmetric argument can be applied to show that traversing for these from the right side of the array also fails. We can observe that thinking irrespective of the policeman and focusing on just the allotment works: 1. Get the lowest index of policeman p and thief t. Make an allotment if |p-t| <= k and increment to the next p and t found. 2. Otherwise increment min(p, t) to the next p or t found. 3. Repeat above two steps until next p and t are found. 4. Return the number of allotments made.Below is the implementation of the above algorithm. It uses vectors to store the indices of police and thief in the array and processes them.Time Complexity: O(N) Auxiliary Space: O(N)Following method works in O(1) space complexityApproach:This approach takes the following steps:Algorithm:1. Initialize the current lowest indices of policeman in pol and thief in thi variable as -1.2 Find the lowest index of policeman and thief.3 If lowest index of either policeman or thief remain -1 then return 0.4 If |pol – thi| <=k then make an allotment and find the next policeman and thief.5 Else increment the min(pol , thi) to the next policeman or thief found.6 Repeat the above two steps until we can find the next policeman and thief.7 Return the number of allotments made.Below is the implementation of the above algorithm.Time Complexity: O(N) Auxiliary Space: O(1)This article is contributed by Satish Srinivas.

      " Given a value V, if we want to make a change for V cents, and we have an infinite supply of each of C = { C1, C2, .., Cm} valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins to make the change? If it’s not possible to make a change, print -1.Examples:This problem is a variation of the problem discussed Coin Change Problem. Here instead of finding the total number of possible solutions, we need to find the solution with the minimum number of coins.The minimum number of coins for a value V can be computed using the below recursive formula.Below is a recursive solution based on the above recursive formula.Output:The time complexity of the above solution is exponential. If we draw the complete recursion tree, we can observe that many subproblems are solved again and again. For example, when we start from V = 11, we can reach 6 by subtracting one 5 times and by subtracting 5 one time. So the subproblem for 6 is called twice.Since the same subproblems are called again, this problem has the Overlapping Subproblems property. So the min coins problem has both properties (see this and this) of a dynamic programming problem. Like other typical Dynamic Programming(DP) problems, recomputations of the same subproblems can be avoided by constructing a temporary array table[][] in a bottom-up manner.

      " A number can always be represented as a sum of squares of other numbers. Note that 1 is a square and we can always break a number as (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + …). Given a number n, find the minimum number of squares that sum to X.Examples :Input:  n = 100Output: 1Explanation:100 can be written as 102. Note that 100 can also be written as 52 + 52 + 52 + 52, but this representation requires 4 squares.Input:  n = 6Output: 3The idea is simple, we start from 1 and go to a number whose square is smaller than or equals n. For every number x, we recur for n-x. Below is the recursive formula.Below is a simple recursive solution based on the above recursive formula.The time complexity of the above solution is exponential. If we draw the recursion tree, we can observe that many subproblems are solved again and again. For example, when we start from n = 6, we can reach 4 by subtracting one 2 times and by subtracting 2 one times. So the subproblem for 4 is called twice.Since the same subproblems are called again, this problem has the Overlapping Subproblems property. So min square sum problem has both properties (see this and this) of a dynamic programming problem. Like other typical Dynamic Programming(DP) problems, recomputations of the same subproblems can be avoided by constructing a temporary array table[][] in a bottom-up manner. Below is a Dynamic programming-based solution.Thanks to Gaurav Ahirwar for suggesting this solution.Another Approach: (USING MEMOIZATION)The problem can be solved using the memoization method (dynamic programming) as well.Below is the implementation:Another Approach:This problem can also be solved by using graphs. Here is the basic idea of how it can be done. We will use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the minimum number of steps from a given value of n to 0. So, for every node, we will push the next possible valid path which is not visited yet into a queue and, and if it reaches node 0, we will update our answer if it is less than the answer.Below is the implementation of the above approach:The time complexity of the above problem is O(n)*sqrt(n) which is better than the Recursive approach. Also, it is a great way to understand how BFS (Breadth-First Search) works.Please write a if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Another Approach:This problem can also be solved using Dynamic programming (Bottom-up approach). The idea is like coin change 2 (in which we need to tell minimum number of coins to make an amount from given coins[] array), here an array of all perfect squares less than or equal to n can be replaced by coins[] array and amount can be replaced by n. Just see this as an unbounded knapsack problem, Let’s see an example:For given input n = 6, we will make an array upto 4,  arr : [1,4]Here, answer will be (4 + 1 + 1 = 6) i.e. 3.Below is the implementation of the above approach:The time complexity of the above problem is O(n)*sqrt(n) as array will be made in sqrt(n) time and for loops for filling dp array will take n*sqrt(n) time atmost. The size of dp array will be n, so space complexity of this approach is O(n).Another Approach: (Using Mathematics)The solution is based on Lagrange’s Four Square Theorem.According to the theorem, there can be atmost 4 solutions to the problem, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4Case 1:Ans = 1 => This can happen iff the number is a square number. n = {a2 : a ∈ W}Example : 1, 4, 9, etc.Case 2:Ans = 2 => This is possible if the number is the sum of 2 square numbers.n = {a2 + b2 : a, b ∈  W}  Example : 2, 5, 18, etc.Case 3:Ans = 3 => This can happen if the number is not of the form 4k(8m + 7).n = {a2 + b2 + c2 : a, b, c ∈  W} ⟷  n ≢ {4k(8m + 7) : k, m ∈ W }Example : 6, 11, 12 etc.Case 4:Ans = 4 => This can happen if the number is of the form 4k(8m + 7).n = {a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 : a, b, c, d ∈  W} ⟷  n ≡  {4k(8m + 7) : k, m ∈ W }Example : 7, 15, 23 etc.Time Complexity : O(sqrt(n))Space Complexity : O(1)Writing code in comment?\n",

      " There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top.Consider the example shown in the diagram. The value of n is 3. There are 3 ways to reach the top. The diagram is taken from Easier Fibonacci puzzlesExamples:Method 1: The first method uses the technique of recursion to solve this problem.Approach: We can easily find the recursive nature in the above problem. The person can reach nth stair from either (n-1)th stair or from (n-2)th stair. Hence, for each stair n, we try to find out the number of ways to reach n-1th stair and n-2th stair and add them to give the answer for the nth stair. Therefore the expression for such an approach comes out to be :The above expression is actually the expression for Fibonacci numbers, but there is one thing to notice, the value of ways(n) is equal to fibonacci(n+1).For a better understanding, let’s refer to the recursion tree below -:So we can use the function for Fibonacci numbers to find the value of ways(n). Following is C++ implementation of the above idea.Complexity Analysis:Generalization of the Problem How to count the number of ways if the person can climb up to m stairs for a given value m. For example, if m is 4, the person can climb 1 stair or 2 stairs or 3 stairs or 4 stairs at a time.Approach: For the generalization of above approach the following recursive relation can be used.In this approach to reach nth stair, try climbing all possible number of stairs lesser than equal to n from present stair.Following is the implementation of above recurrence.Complexity Analysis:Method 2: MemoizationWe can use the bottom-up approach of dp to solve this problem as wellFor this, we can create an array dp[] and initialize it with -1.Whenever we see that a subproblem is not solved we can call the recursive method,else we stop the recursion if that the subproblem is solved already.Complexity Analysis:Time Complexity: O(n)Auxiliary Space: O(n)Method 3: This method uses the technique of Dynamic Programming to arrive at the solution.Approach: We create a table res[] in bottom up manner using the following relation:such that the ith index of the array will contain the number of ways required to reach the ith step considering all the possibilities of climbing (i.e. from 1 to i).Below code implements the above approach:Complexity Analysis:Method 4: The third method uses the technique of Sliding Window to arrive at the solution.Approach: This method efficiently implements the above Dynamic Programming approach. In this approach for the ith stair, we keep a window of sum of last m possible stairs from which we can climb to the ith stair. Instead of running an inner loop, we maintain the result of the inner loop in a temporary variable. We remove the elements of the previous window and add the element of the current window and update the sum.Below code implements the above ideaComplexity Analysis:This article is contributed by Abhishek. Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed aboveMethod 5: The fourth method uses simple mathematics but this is only applicable for this problem if (Order does not matter) while counting steps.Approach: In This method we simply count the number of sets having 2.Complexity Analysis:Note: This Method is only applicable for the question Count ways to N’th Stair(Order does not matter) .Order does not matter means for n = 4  {1 2 1}  ,{2 1 1}  , {1 1 2} are considered same.Method 6: This method uses the technique of Matrix Exponentiation to arrive at the solution.Approach: The number of ways to reach nth stair (Order matters) is equal to the sum of number of ways to reach (n-1)th stair and (n-2)th stairThis corresponds to the following recurrence relation:where f(n) indicates the number of ways to reach nth stairNote:f(1) = 1 because there is only 1 way to reach n=1 stair  {1}f(2) = 2 because there are 2 ways to reach n=2 stairs  {1,1} , {2}It is a type of linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients and we can solve them using Matrix Exponentiation method which basically finds a transformation matrix for a given recurrence relation and repeatedly applies this transformation to a base vector to arrive at the solution).So, for our case the transformation matrix C would be:CN-1 can be calculated using Divide and Conquer technique, in O( (K^3) Log n) where K is dimension of CAnd F(1):As an example, For n= 4:F(4) = C3F(1)C3 =Hence, C3F(1) =Complexity Analysis:Generalization of the Problem:Given an array A {a1, a2, …., am} containing all valid steps, compute the number of ways to reach nth stair. (Order does matter)Examples:Approach:The number of ways to reach nth stair is given by the following recurrence relationLet K be the largest element in A.Step1: Calculate base vector F(1) ( consisting of f(1) …. f(K)  )It can be done in O(m2K)  time using dynamic programming approach as follows:Let’s take A = {2,4,5} as an example. To calculate F(1) = { f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), f(5)  } we will maintain an initially empty array and iteratively append Ai to it and for each Ai we will find the number of ways to reach [Ai-1, to Ai,]Hence for A = {2 ,4 ,5}Let T be the initially empty arrayNote: Since some values are already calculated (1,2 for Iteration 2, etc.) we can avoid them in loopAfter all iterations, the dp array would be: [0,1,0,2,1]Thus, base vector F(1) for A = [2,4,5] is:Now that we have the base vector F(1), calculation of C (Transformation matrix) is easyStep 2: Calculate C, the transformation matrixIt is a matrix having elements Ai,i+1= 1 and last row contains constantsNow constants can be determined by the presence of that element in ASo for A = [2,4,5] constants will be c = [1,1,0,1,0]   (Ci = 1 if (K-i+1) is present in A, or else 0  where 1 <= i <= K )Thus, Transformation matrix C for A =[2,4,5] is:Step 3: Calculate F(n)To calculate F(n), following formula is used:Now that we have C and F(1) we can use Divide and Conquer technique to find Cn-1 and hence the desired outputComplexity Analysis:Note:This approach is ideal when n is too large for iterationFor Example: Consider this approach when (1 ≤ n ≤ 109) and (1 ≤ m,k ≤ 102)Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Given a rod of length L, the task is to cut the rod in such a way that the total number of segments of length p, q and r is maximized. The segments can only be of length p, q, and r.Examples:Input: l = 11, p = 2, q = 3, r = 5 Output: 5 Segments of 2, 2, 2, 2 and 3Input: l = 7, p = 2, q = 5, r = 5 Output: 2 Segments of 2 and 5Approach 1:This can be visualized as a classical recursion problem , which further narrows down to memoization ( top-down ) method of Dynamic Programming. Initially , we have length l present with us , we’d have three size choices to cut from this , either we can make a cut of length p , or q , or r. Let’s say we made a cut of length p , so the remaining length would be l-p and similarly with cuts q & r resulting in remaining lengths l-q & l-r respectively. We will call recursive function for the remaining lengths and at any subsequent instance we’ll have these three choices. We will store the answer from all these recursive calls & take the maximum out of them +1 as at any instance we’ll have 1 cut from this particular call as well. Also , note that the recursive call would be made if and only if the available length is greater than length we want to cut i.e. suppose p=3 , and after certain recursive calls the available length is 2 only , so we can’t cut this line in lengths of p anymore.Below is the pseudocode for the same:Below is the recursion tree for l=4,p=2,q=1 and r=1:Recursion Tree for l=4 , p=2 ,q=1 and r=1One can clearly observe that at each call , the given length ( 4 initially ) is divided into 3 different subparts. Also , we can see that the recursion is being repeated for certain entries ( Red arrow represents repetitive call for l=2, Yellow for l=3 and Blue for l=1). Therefore , we can memoize the results in any container or array , so that repetition of same recursive calls is avoided.Now , the above pseudocode changes to :Let’s now follow the code for implementation of the above code :Time Complexity : O(n) where n is the length of rod or line segment that has to be cut.Space Complexity : O(n) where n is the length of rod or line segment that has to be cut.Approach 2:As the solution for a maximum number of cuts that can be made in a given length depends on the maximum number of cuts previously made in shorter lengths, this question could be solved by the approach of Dynamic Programming. Suppose we are given a length ‘l’. For finding the maximum number of cuts that can be made in length ‘l’, find the number of cuts made in shorter previous length ‘l-p’, ‘l-q’, ‘l-r’ lengths respectively. The required answer would be the max(l-p,l-q,l-r)+1 as one more cut should be needed after this to cut length ‘l’. So for solving this problem for a given length, find the maximum number of cuts that can be made in lengths ranging from ‘1’ to ‘l’.Example:l = 11, p = 2, q = 3, r = 5 Analysing lengths from 1 to 11:Algorithm:Pseudo Code:Implementation:Complexity Analysis:Note: This problem can also be thought of as a minimum coin change problem because we are given a certain length to acquire which is the same as the value of the amount whose minimum change is needed. Now the x,y,z are the same as the denomination of the coin given. So length is the same as the amount and x y z are the same as denominations, thus we need to change only one condition that is instead of finding minimum we need to find the maximum and we will get the answer. As the minimum coin change problem is the basic dynamic programming question so this will help to solve this question also.The condition we need to change in minimum coin change problemWriting code in comment?\n",

For n > 1, it should return Fn-1 + Fn-2Following are different methods to get the nth Fibonacci number.Method 1 (Use recursion) A simple method that is a direct recursive implementation mathematical recurrence relation is given above.Time Complexity: T(n) = T(n) which is linear.If the original recursion tree were to be implemented then this would have been the tree but now for n times the recursion function is calledOriginal tree for recursionOptimized tree for recursion for code abovefib(5)fib(4)fib(3)fib(2)fib(1)Extra Space: O(n) if we consider the function call stack size, otherwise O(1).Method 2 (Use Dynamic Programming) We can avoid the repeated work done in method 1 by storing the Fibonacci numbers calculated so far.Method 3 (Space Optimized Method 2) We can optimize the space used in method 2 by storing the previous two numbers only because that is all we need to get the next Fibonacci number in series.Time Complexity:O(n) Extra Space: O(1)Method 4 (Using power of the matrix {{1, 1}, {1, 0}}) This another O(n) which relies on the fact that if we n times multiply the matrix M = {{1,1},{1,0}} to itself (in other words calculate power(M, n)), then we get the (n+1)th Fibonacci number as the element at row and column (0, 0) in the resultant matrix.The matrix representation gives the following closed expression for the Fibonacci numbers:Time Complexity: O(n) Extra Space: O(1)Method 5 (Optimized Method 4) The method 4 can be optimized to work in O(Logn) time complexity. We can do recursive multiplication to get power(M, n) in the previous method (Similar to the optimization done in this post)Time Complexity: O(Logn) Extra Space: O(Logn) if we consider the function call stack size, otherwise O(1).Method 6 (O(Log n) Time)Below is one more interesting recurrence formula that can be used to find n’th Fibonacci Number in O(Log n) time.How does this formula work? The formula can be derived from above matrix equation.Below is the implementation of above idea.Time complexity of this solution is O(Log n) as we divide the problem to half in every recursive call.Method 7Another approach(Using formula) :In this method we directly implement the formula for nth term in the fibonacci series. Fn = {[(√5 + 1)/2] ^ n} / √5Reference: http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibFormula.htmlTime Complexity: O(logn), this is because calculating phi^n takes logn timeSpace Complexity: O(1)Method 8DP using memoization(Top down approach)We can avoid the repeated work done in method 1 by storing the Fibonacci numbers calculated so far. We just need to store all the values in an array.Related Articles: Large Fibonacci Numbers in JavaPlease write comments if you find the above codes/algorithms incorrect, or find other ways to solve the same problem.References: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/161/960109.htmlWriting code in comment?\n",

      "  You are given a set of n types of rectangular 3-D boxes, where the i^th box has height h(i), width w(i) and depth d(i) (all real numbers). You want to create a stack of boxes which is as tall as possible, but you can only stack a box on top of another box if the dimensions of the 2-D base of the lower box are each strictly larger than those of the 2-D base of the higher box. Of course, you can rotate a box so that any side functions as its base. It is also allowable to use multiple instances of the same type of box. Source: http://people.csail.mit.edu/bdean/6.046/dp/. The link also has a video for an explanation of the solution.The Box Stacking problem is a variation of LIS problem. We need to build a maximum height stack. Following are the key points to note in the problem statement: 1) A box can be placed on top of another box only if both width and depth of the upper placed box are smaller than width and depth of the lower box respectively. 2) We can rotate boxes such that width is smaller than depth. For example, if there is a box with dimensions {1x2x3} where 1 is height, 2×3 is base, then there can be three possibilities, {1x2x3}, {2x1x3} and {3x1x2} 3) We can use multiple instances of boxes. What it means is, we can have two different rotations of a box as part of our maximum height stack.Following is the solution based on DP solution of LIS problem.Method 1 : dynamic programming using tabulation1) Generate all 3 rotations of all boxes. The size of rotation array becomes 3 times the size of the original array. For simplicity, we consider width as always smaller than or equal to depth. 2) Sort the above generated 3n boxes in decreasing order of base area.3) After sorting the boxes, the problem is same as LIS with following optimal substructure property. MSH(i) = Maximum possible Stack Height with box i at top of stack MSH(i) = { Max ( MSH(j) ) + height(i) } where j < i and width(j) > width(i) and depth(j) > depth(i). If there is no such j then MSH(i) = height(i)4) To get overall maximum height, we return max(MSH(i)) where 0 < i < nFollowing is the implementation of the above solution.In the above program, given input boxes are {4, 6, 7}, {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {10, 12, 32}. Following are all rotations of the boxes in decreasing order of base area.The height 60 is obtained by boxes { {3, 1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {6, 4, 5}, {4, 5, 6}, {4, 6, 7}, {32, 10, 12}, {10, 12, 32}}Time Complexity: O(n^2) Auxiliary Space: O(n)Method 2 : dynamic programming using memoization (top-down)In the above program,  for boxes of dimensions of {4, 6, 7}, {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {10, 12, 32} on giving the input as {4, 1, 4, 10} for length, {6, 2, 5, 12} for width and {7, 3, 6, 32} for height. Following rotations are possible for the boxes in decreasing order of base area.The height 60 is obtained by boxes { {2, 1, 3}, {3, 2, 1}, {5, 4, 6}, {6, 5, 4}, {7, 6, 4}, {12, 10, 32}, {32, 12, 10}}Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      "generate link and share the link here.Given two strings str1 and str2 and below operations that can be performed on str1. Find minimum number of edits (operations) required to convert ‘str1’ into ‘str2’.All of the above operations are of equal cost.Examples:What are the subproblems in this case? The idea is to process all characters one by one starting from either from left or right sides of both strings. Let us traverse from right corner, there are two possibilities for every pair of character being traversed.Below is implementation of above Naive recursive solution.The time complexity of above solution is exponential. In worst case, we may end up doing O(3m) operations. The worst case happens when none of characters of two strings match. Below is a recursive call diagram for worst case.We can see that many subproblems are solved, again and again, for example, eD(2, 2) is called three times. Since same subproblems are called again, this problem has Overlapping Subproblems property. So Edit Distance problem has both properties (see this and this) of a dynamic programming problem. Like other typical Dynamic Programming(DP) problems, recomputations of same subproblems can be avoided by constructing a temporary array that stores results of subproblems.Time Complexity: O(m x n) Auxiliary Space: O(m x n)Space Complex Solution: In the above-given method we require O(m x n) space. This will not be suitable if the length of strings is greater than 2000 as it can only create 2D array of 2000 x 2000. To fill a row in DP array we require only one row the upper row. For example, if we are filling the i = 10 rows in DP array we require only values of 9th row. So we simply create a DP array of 2 x str1 length. This approach reduces the space complexity. Here is the C++ implementation of the above-mentioned problemTime Complexity: O(m x n) Auxiliary Space: O( m )This is a memoized version of recursion i.e. Top-Down DP:Applications: There are many practical applications of edit distance algorithm, refer Lucene API for sample. Another example, display all the words in a dictionary that are near proximity to a given wordincorrectly spelled word.Thanks to Vivek Kumar for suggesting updates.Thanks to Venki for providing initial post.

      " We have already discussed Overlapping Subproblems and Optimal Substructure properties. Now, let us discuss the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem as an example problem that can be solved using Dynamic Programming.The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, the length of LIS for {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80} is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.Examples:Method 1: Recursion.Optimal Substructure: Let arr[0..n-1] be the input array and L(i) be the length of the LIS ending at index i such that arr[i] is the last element of the LIS.Then, L(i) can be recursively written as:To find the LIS for a given array, we need to return max(L(i)) where 0 < i < n.Formally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i, will be 1 greater than the maximum of lengths of all longest increasing subsequences ending at indices before i, where arr[j] < arr[i] (j < i).Thus, we see the LIS problem satisfies the optimal substructure property as the main problem can be solved using solutions to subproblems.The recursive tree given below will make the approach clearer:Below is the implementation of the recursive approach:Complexity Analysis:Method 2: Dynamic Programming.We can see that there are many subproblems in the above recursive solution which are solved again and again. So this problem has Overlapping Substructure property and recomputation of same subproblems can be avoided by either using Memoization or Tabulation.The simulation of approach will make things clear:Iteration-wise simulation :We can avoid recomputation of subproblems by using tabulation as shown in the below code:Below is the implementation of the above approach:Complexity Analysis:Note: The time complexity of the above Dynamic Programming (DP) solution is O(n^2) and there is a O(N log N) solution for the LIS problem. We have not discussed the O(N log N) solution here as the purpose of this post is to explain Dynamic Programming with a simple example. See below post for O(N log N) solution. Longest Increasing Subsequence Size (N log N)Method 3: Dynamic ProgrammingIf we closely observe the problem then we can convert this problem to longest Common Subsequence Problem. Firstly we will create another array of unique elements of original array and sort it. Now the longest increasing subsequence of our array must be present as a subsequence in our sorted array. That’s why our problem is now reduced to finding the common subsequence between the two arrays.Complexity Analysis : O(n*n)As nested loop is usedSpace Complexity : O(n*n)As a matrix is used for storing the values.Method 4 : Memoization DPThis is extension of recursive methodWe can see that there are many subproblems in the above recursive solution which are solved again and again. So this problem has Overlapping Substructure property and recomputation of same subproblems can be avoided by either using MemoizationComplexity Analysis:Time Complexity: O(n2). Auxiliary Space: O(n2).Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Given two strings ‘X’ and ‘Y’, find the length of the longest common substring.Examples :Input : X = “GeeksforGeeks”, y = “GeeksQuiz” Output : 5 Explanation:The longest common substring is “Geeks” and is of length 5.Input : X = “abcdxyz”, y = “xyzabcd” Output : 4 Explanation:The longest common substring is “abcd” and is of length 4.Input : X = “zxabcdezy”, y = “yzabcdezx” Output : 6 Explanation:The longest common substring is “abcdez” and is of length 6.Approach:Let m and n be the lengths of the first and second strings respectively.A simple solution is to one by one consider all substrings of the first string and for every substring check if it is a substring in the second string. Keep track of the maximum length substring. There will be O(m^2) substrings and we can find whether a string is substring on another string in O(n) time (See this). So overall time complexity of this method would be O(n * m2)Dynamic Programming can be used to find the longest common substring in O(m*n) time. The idea is to find the length of the longest common suffix for all substrings of both strings and store these lengths in a table.The longest common suffix has following optimal substructure property. If last characters match, then we reduce both lengths by 1 LCSuff(X, Y, m, n) = LCSuff(X, Y, m-1, n-1) + 1 if X[m-1] = Y[n-1] If last characters do not match, then result is 0, i.e., LCSuff(X, Y, m, n) = 0 if (X[m-1] != Y[n-1])Now we consider suffixes of different substrings ending at different indexes. The maximum length Longest Common Suffix is the longest common substring. LCSubStr(X, Y, m, n) = Max(LCSuff(X, Y, i, j)) where 1 <= i <= m and 1 <= j <= nFollowing is the iterative implementation of the above solution.Time Complexity: O(m*n) Auxiliary Space: O(m*n)Another approach: (Space optimized approach).In the above approach, we are only using the last row of the 2-D array only, hence we can optimize the space by using a 2-D array of dimension 2*(min(n,m)).Below is the implementation of the above approach:Time Complexity: O(n*m)Auxiliary Space: O(min(m,n))Another approach: (Using recursion) Here is the recursive solution of the above approach.We need to find the solution diagonally upwards. In this particular example:Like this, we need to remember only the previous computation.Time Complexity:Space Complexity:References: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_substring_problemThe longest substring can also be solved in O(n+m) time using the Suffix Tree. We will be covering the Suffix Tree-based solution in a separate post.Exercise: The above solution prints only the length of the longest common substring. Extend the solution to print the substring also.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " We have discussed Overlapping Subproblems and Optimal Substructure properties in Set 1 and Set 2 respectively. We also discussed one example problem in Set 3. Let us discuss Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem as one more example problem that can be solved using Dynamic Programming.LCS Problem Statement: Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of “abcdefg”.In order to find out the complexity of brute force approach, we need to first know the number of possible different subsequences of a string with length n, i.e., find the number of subsequences with lengths ranging from 1,2,..n-1. Recall from theory of permutation and combination that number of combinations with 1 element are nC1. Number of combinations with 2 elements are nC2 and so forth and so on. We know that nC0 + nC1 + nC2 + … nCn = 2n. So a string of length n has 2n-1 different possible subsequences since we do not consider the subsequence with length 0. This implies that the time complexity of the brute force approach will be O(n * 2n). Note that it takes O(n) time to check if a subsequence is common to both the strings. This time complexity can be improved using dynamic programming.It is a classic computer science problem, the basis of diff (a file comparison program that outputs the differences between two files), and has applications in bioinformatics.Examples: LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3. LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB” of length 4.The naive solution for this problem is to generate all subsequences of both given sequences and find the longest matching subsequence. This solution is exponential in term of time complexity. Let us see how this problem possesses both important properties of a Dynamic Programming (DP) Problem.1) Optimal Substructure: Let the input sequences be X[0..m-1] and Y[0..n-1] of lengths m and n respectively. And let L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) be the length of LCS of the two sequences X and Y. Following is the recursive definition of L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]).If last characters of both sequences match (or X[m-1] == Y[n-1]) then L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = 1 + L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-2])If last characters of both sequences do not match (or X[m-1] != Y[n-1]) then L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = MAX ( L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-1]), L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-2]) )Examples: 1) Consider the input strings “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB”. Last characters match for the strings. So length of LCS can be written as: L(“AGGTAB”, “GXTXAYB”) = 1 + L(“AGGTA”, “GXTXAY”)2) Consider the input strings “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR. Last characters do not match for the strings. So length of LCS can be written as: L(“ABCDGH”, “AEDFHR”) = MAX ( L(“ABCDG”, “AEDFHR”), L(“ABCDGH”, “AEDFH”) )So the LCS problem has optimal substructure property as the main problem can be solved using solutions to subproblems.2) Overlapping Subproblems: Following is simple recursive implementation of the LCS problem. The implementation simply follows the recursive structure mentioned above.Time complexity of the above naive recursive approach is O(2^n) in worst case and worst case happens when all characters of X and Y mismatch i.e., length of LCS is 0.Considering the above implementation, following is a partial recursion tree for input strings “AXYT” and “AYZX”In the above partial recursion tree, lcs(“AXY”, “AYZ”) is being solved twice. If we draw the complete recursion tree, then we can see that there are many subproblems which are solved again and again. So this problem has Overlapping Substructure property and recomputation of same subproblems can be avoided by either using Memoization or Tabulation.Following is a Memoization implementation for the LCS problem.Time Complexity : O(mn) ignoring recursion stack spaceFollowing is a tabulated implementation for the LCS problem.Time Complexity of the above implementation is O(mn) which is much better than the worst-case time complexity of Naive Recursive implementation. The above algorithm/code returns only length of LCS. Please see the following post for printing the LCS. Printing Longest Common Subsequence You can also check the space optimized version of LCS at Space Optimized Solution of LCSPlease write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Recent Articles based on LCS!References: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5hZoJ6uK-s http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Longest_Common_Subsequence http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/161/960229.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problemWriting code in comment?\n",

      " Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.Pseudo Code for recursive QuickSort function :Partition Algorithm There can be many ways to do partition, following pseudo code adopts the method given in CLRS book. The logic is simple, we start from the leftmost element and keep track of index of smaller (or equal to) elements as i. While traversing, if we find a smaller element, we swap current element with arr[i]. Otherwise we ignore current element.Pseudo code for partition()Illustration of partition() :Implementation: Following are the implementations of QuickSort:Analysis of QuickSort Time taken by QuickSort, in general, can be written as following.The first two terms are for two recursive calls, the last term is for the partition process. k is the number of elements which are smaller than pivot. The time taken by QuickSort depends upon the input array and partition strategy. Following are three cases.Worst Case: The worst case occurs when the partition process always picks greatest or smallest element as pivot. If we consider above partition strategy where last element is always picked as pivot, the worst case would occur when the array is already sorted in increasing or decreasing order. Following is recurrence for worst case.The solution of above recurrence is  (n2).Best Case: The best case occurs when the partition process always picks the middle element as pivot. Following is recurrence for best case.The solution of above recurrence is (nLogn). It can be solved using case 2 of Master Theorem.Average Case: To do average case analysis, we need to consider all possible permutation of array and calculate time taken by every permutation which doesn’t look easy. We can get an idea of average case by considering the case when partition puts O(n/9) elements in one set and O(9n/10) elements in other set. Following is recurrence for this case.The solution of above recurrence is also O(nLogn)Although the worst case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n2) which is more than many other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort, QuickSort is faster in practice, because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures, and in most real-world data. QuickSort can be implemented in different ways by changing the choice of pivot, so that the worst case rarely occurs for a given type of data. However, merge sort is generally considered better when data is huge and stored in external storage.Is QuickSort stable? The default implementation is not stable. However any sorting algorithm can be made stable by considering indexes as comparison parameter.Is QuickSort In-place? As per the broad definition of in-place algorithm it qualifies as an in-place sorting algorithm as it uses extra space only for storing recursive function calls but not for manipulating the input.What is 3-Way QuickSort? In simple QuickSort algorithm, we select an element as pivot, partition the array around pivot and recur for subarrays on left and right of pivot. Consider an array which has many redundant elements. For example, {1, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4}. If 4 is picked as pivot in Simple QuickSort, we fix only one 4 and recursively process remaining occurrences. In 3 Way QuickSort, an array arr[l..r] is divided in 3 parts: a) arr[l..i] elements less than pivot. b) arr[i+1..j-1] elements equal to pivot. c) arr[j..r] elements greater than pivot. See this for implementation.How to implement QuickSort for Linked Lists? QuickSort on Singly Linked List QuickSort on Doubly Linked ListCan we implement QuickSort Iteratively? Yes, please refer Iterative Quick Sort.Why Quick Sort is preferred over MergeSort for sorting Arrays Quick Sort in its general form is an in-place sort (i.e. it doesn’t require any extra storage) whereas merge sort requires O(N) extra storage, N denoting the array size which may be quite expensive. Allocating and de-allocating the extra space used for merge sort increases the running time of the algorithm. Comparing average complexity we find that both type of sorts have O(NlogN) average complexity but the constants differ. For arrays, merge sort loses due to the use of extra O(N) storage space.Most practical implementations of Quick Sort use randomized version. The randomized version has expected time complexity of O(nLogn). The worst case is possible in randomized version also, but worst case doesn’t occur for a particular pattern (like sorted array) and randomized Quick Sort works well in practice.Quick Sort is also a cache friendly sorting algorithm as it has good locality of reference when used for arrays.Quick Sort is also tail recursive, therefore tail call optimizations is done.Why MergeSort is preferred over QuickSort for Linked Lists? In case of linked lists the case is different mainly due to difference in memory allocation of arrays and linked lists. Unlike arrays, linked list nodes may not be adjacent in memory. Unlike array, in linked list, we can insert items in the middle in O(1) extra space and O(1) time. Therefore merge operation of merge sort can be implemented without extra space for linked lists.In arrays, we can do random access as elements are continuous in memory. Let us say we have an integer (4-byte) array A and let the address of A[0] be x then to access A[i], we can directly access the memory at (x + i*4). Unlike arrays, we can not do random access in linked list. Quick Sort requires a lot of this kind of access. In linked list to access i’th index, we have to travel each and every node from the head to i’th node as we don’t have continuous block of memory. Therefore, the overhead increases for quick sort. Merge sort accesses data sequentially and the need of random access is low.How to optimize QuickSort so that it takes O(Log n) extra space in worst case? Please see QuickSort Tail Call Optimization (Reducing worst case space to Log n )Snapshots:References: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuicksortOther Sorting Algorithms on GeeksforGeeks/GeeksQuiz: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, QuickSort, Radix Sort, Counting Sort, Bucket Sort, ShellSort, Comb Sort, Pigeonhole SortPlease write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.What is Binary Heap? Let us first define a Complete Binary Tree. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible (Source Wikipedia)A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree where items are stored in a special order such that the value in a parent node is greater(or smaller) than the values in its two children nodes. The former is called max heap and the latter is called min-heap. The heap can be represented by a binary tree or array.Why array based representation for Binary Heap? Since a Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree, it can be easily represented as an array and the array-based representation is space-efficient. If the parent node is stored at index I, the left child can be calculated by 2 * I + 1 and the right child by 2 * I + 2 (assuming the indexing starts at 0).How to “heapify” a tree?The process of reshaping a binary tree into a Heap data structure is known as ‘heapify’. A binary tree is a tree data structure that has two child nodes at max. If a node’s children nodes are ‘heapified’, then only ‘heapify’ process can be applied over that node. A heap should always be a complete binary tree.Starting from a complete binary tree, we can modify it to become a Max-Heap by running a function called ‘heapify’ on all the non-leaf elements of the heap. i.e. ‘heapify’ uses recursion.Algorithm for “heapify”:Example of “heapify”:Heap Sort Algorithm for sorting in increasing order: 1. Build a max heap from the input data. 2. At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1. Finally, heapify the root of the tree. 3. Repeat step 2 while the size of the heap is greater than 1.How to build the heap? Heapify procedure can be applied to a node only if its children nodes are heapified. So the heapification must be performed in the bottom-up order.Lets understand with the help of an example:Here is previous C code for reference.Notes: Heap sort is an in-place algorithm. Its typical implementation is not stable, but can be made stable (See this)Time Complexity: Time complexity of heapify is O(Logn). Time complexity of createAndBuildHeap() is O(n) and the overall time complexity of Heap Sort is O(nLogn).Advantages of heapsort –Other Sorting Algorithms on GeeksforGeeks/GeeksQuiz:QuickSort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, QuickSort, Radix Sort, Counting Sort, Bucket Sort, ShellSort, Comb Sort, Pigeonhole SortCoding practice for sorting.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. It works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (kind of hashing). Then do some arithmetic to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence.Counting sort makes assumptions about the data, for example, it assumes that values are going to be in the range of 0 to 10 or 10 – 99 etc, Some other assumptions counting sort makes are input data will be all real numbers.Like other algorithms this sorting algorithm is not a comparison-based algorithm, it hashes the value in a temporary count array and uses them for sorting.It uses a temporary array making it a non In Place algorithm.Let us understand it with the help of an example.Following is the implementation of the counting sort.Output:Time Complexity: O(n+k) where n is the number of elements in the input array and k is the range of input. Auxiliary Space: O(n+k)The problem with the previous counting sort was that we could not sort the elements if we have negative numbers in it. Because there are no negative array indices. So what we do is, we find the minimum element and we will store the count of that minimum element at zero index.Output:Points to be noted:Exercise: 1. Modify the above code to sort the input data in the range from M to N. 2. Modify the code to make the counting sort stable.3.

      " Like QuickSort, Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then it merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves. The merge(arr, l, m, r) is a key process that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one. See the following C implementation for details.The following diagram from wikipedia shows the complete merge sort process for an example array {38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10}. If we take a closer look at the diagram, we can see that the array is recursively divided into two halves till the size becomes 1. Once the size becomes 1, the merge processes come into action and start merging arrays back till the complete array is merged.Time Complexity: Sorting arrays on different machines. Merge Sort is a recursive algorithm and time complexity can be expressed as following recurrence relation. T(n) = 2T(n/2) + θ(n)The above recurrence can be solved either using the Recurrence Tree method or the Master method. It falls in case II of Master Method and the solution of the recurrence is θ(nLogn). Time complexity of Merge Sort is  θ(nLogn) in all 3 cases (worst, average and best) as merge sort always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves.Auxiliary Space: O(n)Algorithmic Paradigm: Divide and ConquerSorting In Place: No in a typical implementationStable: YesApplications of Merge SortDrawbacks of Merge SortOther Sorting Algorithms on GeeksforGeeks: 3-way Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, QuickSort, Radix Sort, Counting Sort, Bucket Sort, ShellSort, Comb SortPlease write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Write an efficient program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum.Kadane’s Algorithm:Explanation: The simple idea of Kadane’s algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array (max_ending_here is used for this). And keep track of maximum sum contiguous segment among all positive segments (max_so_far is used for this). Each time we get a positive sum compare it with max_so_far and update max_so_far if it is greater than max_so_farProgram:Output:Another approach:Time Complexity: O(n)Algorithmic Paradigm: Dynamic ProgrammingFollowing is another simple implementation suggested by Mohit Kumar. The implementation handles the case when all numbers in the array are negative.Output:To print the subarray with the maximum sum, we maintain indices whenever we get the maximum sum.Output:Kadane’s Algorithm can be viewed both as a greedy and DP. As we can see that we are keeping a running sum of integers and when it becomes less than 0, we reset it to 0 (Greedy Part). This is because continuing with a negative sum is way more worse than restarting with a new range. Now it can also be viewed as a DP, at each stage we have 2 choices: Either take the current element and continue with previous sum OR restart a new range. These both choices are being taken care of in the implementation.Time Complexity: O(n)Auxiliary Space: O(1)Now try the below question Given an array of integers (possibly some elements negative), write a C program to find out the *maximum product* possible by multiplying ‘n’ consecutive integers in the array where n ≤ ARRAY_SIZE.

      " We have discussed Kruskal’s algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree. Like Kruskal’s algorithm, Prim’s algorithm is also a Greedy algorithm. It starts with an empty spanning tree. The idea is to maintain two sets of vertices. The first set contains the vertices already included in the MST, the other set contains the vertices not yet included. At every step, it considers all the edges that connect the two sets, and picks the minimum weight edge from these edges. After picking the edge, it moves the other endpoint of the edge to the set containing MST. A group of edges that connects two set of vertices in a graph is called cut in graph theory. So, at every step of Prim’s algorithm, we find a cut (of two sets, one contains the vertices already included in MST and other contains rest of the vertices), pick the minimum weight edge from the cut and include this vertex to MST Set (the set that contains already included vertices).How does Prim’s Algorithm Work? The idea behind Prim’s algorithm is simple, a spanning tree means all vertices must be connected. So the two disjoint subsets (discussed above) of vertices must be connected to make a Spanning Tree. And they must be connected with the minimum weight edge to make it a Minimum Spanning Tree.Algorithm 1) Create a set mstSet that keeps track of vertices already included in MST. 2) Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all key values as INFINITE. Assign key value as 0 for the first vertex so that it is picked first. 3) While mstSet doesn’t include all vertices ….a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in mstSet and has minimum key value. ….b) Include u to mstSet. ….c) Update key value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the key values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if weight of edge u-v is less than the previous key value of v, update the key value as weight of u-vThe idea of using key values is to pick the minimum weight edge from cut. The key values are used only for vertices which are not yet included in MST, the key value for these vertices indicate the minimum weight edges connecting them to the set of vertices included in MST.Let us understand with the following example:The set mstSet is initially empty and keys assigned to vertices are {0, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF} where INF indicates infinite. Now pick the vertex with the minimum key value. The vertex 0 is picked, include it in mstSet. So mstSet becomes {0}. After including to mstSet, update key values of adjacent vertices. Adjacent vertices of 0 are 1 and 7. The key values of 1 and 7 are updated as 4 and 8. Following subgraph shows vertices and their key values, only the vertices with finite key values are shown. The vertices included in MST are shown in green color.Pick the vertex with minimum key value and not already included in MST (not in mstSET). The vertex 1 is picked and added to mstSet. So mstSet now becomes {0, 1}. Update the key values of adjacent vertices of 1. The key value of vertex 2 becomes 8.Pick the vertex with minimum key value and not already included in MST (not in mstSET). We can either pick vertex 7 or vertex 2, let vertex 7 is picked. So mstSet now becomes {0, 1, 7}. Update the key values of adjacent vertices of 7. The key value of vertex 6 and 8 becomes finite (1 and 7 respectively).Pick the vertex with minimum key value and not already included in MST (not in mstSET). Vertex 6 is picked. So mstSet now becomes {0, 1, 7, 6}. Update the key values of adjacent vertices of 6. The key value of vertex 5 and 8 are updated.We repeat the above steps until mstSet includes all vertices of given graph. Finally, we get the following graph.How to implement the above algorithm? We use a boolean array mstSet[] to represent the set of vertices included in MST. If a value mstSet[v] is true, then vertex v is included in MST, otherwise not. Array key[] is used to store key values of all vertices. Another array parent[] to store indexes of parent nodes in MST. The parent array is the output array which is used to show the constructed MST.Output:Time Complexity of the above program is O(V^2). If the input graph is represented using adjacency list, then the time complexity of Prim’s algorithm can be reduced to O(E log V) with the help of binary heap.

      " Given a graph and a source vertex src in graph, find shortest paths from src to all vertices in the given graph. The graph may contain negative weight edges. We have discussed Dijkstra’s algorithm for this problem. Dijkstra’s algorithm is a Greedy algorithm and time complexity is O((V+E)LogV) (with the use of Fibonacci heap). Dijkstra doesn’t work for Graphs with negative weights, Bellman-Ford works for such graphs. Bellman-Ford is also simpler than Dijkstra and suites well for distributed systems. But time complexity of Bellman-Ford is O(VE), which is more than Dijkstra.Algorithm Following are the detailed steps.Input: Graph and a source vertex src Output: Shortest distance to all vertices from src. If there is a negative weight cycle, then shortest distances are not calculated, negative weight cycle is reported.1) This step initializes distances from the source to all vertices as infinite and distance to the source itself as 0. Create an array dist[] of size |V| with all values as infinite except dist[src] where src is source vertex.2) This step calculates shortest distances. Do following |V|-1 times where |V| is the number of vertices in given graph. …..a) Do following for each edge u-v ………………If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then update dist[v] ………………….dist[v] = dist[u] + weight of edge uv3) This step reports if there is a negative weight cycle in graph. Do following for each edge u-v ……If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then “Graph contains negative weight cycle” The idea of step 3 is, step 2 guarantees the shortest distances if the graph doesn’t contain a negative weight cycle. If we iterate through all edges one more time and get a shorter path for any vertex, then there is a negative weight cycleHow does this work? Like other Dynamic Programming Problems, the algorithm calculates shortest paths in a bottom-up manner. It first calculates the shortest distances which have at-most one edge in the path. Then, it calculates the shortest paths with at-most 2 edges, and so on. After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the shortest paths with at most i edges are calculated. There can be maximum |V| – 1 edges in any simple path, that is why the outer loop runs |v| – 1 times. The idea is, assuming that there is no negative weight cycle, if we have calculated shortest paths with at most i edges, then an iteration over all edges guarantees to give shortest path with at-most (i+1) edges (Proof is simple, you can refer this or MIT Video Lecture)Example Let us understand the algorithm with following example graph. The images are taken from this source.Let the given source vertex be 0. Initialize all distances as infinite, except the distance to the source itself. Total number of vertices in the graph is 5, so all edges must be processed 4 times.Let all edges are processed in the following order: (B, E), (D, B), (B, D), (A, B), (A, C), (D, C), (B, C), (E, D). We get the following distances when all edges are processed the first time. The first row shows initial distances. The second row shows distances when edges (B, E), (D, B), (B, D) and (A, B) are processed. The third row shows distances when (A, C) is processed. The fourth row shows when (D, C), (B, C) and (E, D) are processed.The first iteration guarantees to give all shortest paths which are at most 1 edge long. We get the following distances when all edges are processed second time (The last row shows final values).The second iteration guarantees to give all shortest paths which are at most 2 edges long. The algorithm processes all edges 2 more times. The distances are minimized after the second iteration, so third and fourth iterations don’t update the distances.Implementation:Output:Notes 1) Negative weights are found in various applications of graphs. For example, instead of paying cost for a path, we may get some advantage if we follow the path.2) Bellman-Ford works better (better than Dijkstra’s) for distributed systems. Unlike Dijkstra’s where we need to find the minimum value of all vertices, in Bellman-Ford, edges are considered one by one.                                                                  3) Bellman-Ford does not work with undirected graph with negative edges as it will declared as negative cycle.Exercise 1) The standard Bellman-Ford algorithm reports the shortest path only if there are no negative weight cycles. Modify it so that it reports minimum distances even if there is a negative weight cycle.2) Can we use Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths for graphs with negative weights – one idea can be, calculate the minimum weight value, add a positive value (equal to absolute value of minimum weight value) to all weights and run the Dijkstra’s algorithm for the modified graph. Will this algorithm work?Bellman Ford Algorithm (Simple Implementation)References: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttezuzs39nk http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm http://www.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs445/spring07/ShortestPath2.prn.pdfPlease write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      "Given a graph and a source vertex in the graph, find the shortest paths from the source to all vertices in the given graph.Dijkstra’s algorithm is very similar to Prim’s algorithm for minimum spanning tree. Like Prim’s MST, we generate a SPT (shortest path tree) with a given source as a root. We maintain two sets, one set contains vertices included in the shortest-path tree, other set includes vertices not yet included in the shortest-path tree. At every step of the algorithm, we find a vertex that is in the other set (set of not yet included) and has a minimum distance from the source.Below are the detailed steps used in Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in the given graph.Algorithm 1) Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of vertices included in the shortest-path tree, i.e., whose minimum distance from the source is calculated and finalized. Initially, this set is empty. 2) Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all distance values as INFINITE. Assign distance value as 0 for the source vertex so that it is picked first. 3) While sptSet doesn’t include all vertices ….a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in sptSet and has a minimum distance value. ….b) Include u to sptSet. ….c) Update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the distance values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if the sum of distance value of u (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less than the distance value of v, then update the distance value of v.Let us understand with the following example:The set sptSet is initially empty and distances assigned to vertices are {0, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF} where INF indicates infinite. Now pick the vertex with a minimum distance value. The vertex 0 is picked, include it in sptSet. So sptSet becomes {0}. After including 0 to sptSet, update distance values of its adjacent vertices. Adjacent vertices of 0 are 1 and 7. The distance values of 1 and 7 are updated as 4 and 8. The following subgraph shows vertices and their distance values, only the vertices with finite distance values are shown. The vertices included in SPT are shown in green colour.Pick the vertex with minimum distance value and not already included in SPT (not in sptSET). The vertex 1 is picked and added to sptSet. So sptSet now becomes {0, 1}. Update the distance values of adjacent vertices of 1. The distance value of vertex 2 becomes 12.Pick the vertex with minimum distance value and not already included in SPT (not in sptSET). Vertex 7 is picked. So sptSet now becomes {0, 1, 7}. Update the distance values of adjacent vertices of 7. The distance value of vertex 6 and 8 becomes finite (15 and 9 respectively).Pick the vertex with minimum distance value and not already included in SPT (not in sptSET). Vertex 6 is picked. So sptSet now becomes {0, 1, 7, 6}. Update the distance values of adjacent vertices of 6. The distance value of vertex 5 and 8 are updated.We repeat the above steps until sptSet includes all vertices of the given graph. Finally, we get the following Shortest Path Tree (SPT).How to implement the above algorithm?We use a boolean array sptSet[] to represent the set of vertices included in SPT. If a value sptSet[v] is true, then vertex v is included in SPT, otherwise not. Array dist[] is used to store the shortest distance values of all vertices.Output:Notes: 1) The code calculates the shortest distance but doesn’t calculate the path information. We can create a parent array, update the parent array when distance is updated (like prim’s implementation) and use it to show the shortest path from source to different vertices.2) The code is for undirected graphs, the same Dijkstra function can be used for directed graphs also.3) The code finds the shortest distances from the source to all vertices. If we are interested only in the shortest distance from the source to a single target, we can break the for loop when the picked minimum distance vertex is equal to the target (Step 3.a of the algorithm).4) Time Complexity of the implementation is O(V^2). If the input graph is represented using adjacency list, it can be reduced to O(E log V) with the help of a binary heap. Please see Dijkstra’s Algorithm for Adjacency List Representation for more details.5) Dijkstra’s algorithm doesn’t work for graphs with negative weight cycles. It may give correct results for a graph with negative edges but you must allow a vertex can be visited multiple times and that version will lose its fast time complexity. For graphs with negative weight edges and cycles, Bellman–Ford algorithm can be used, we will soon be discussing it as a separate post.Dijkstra’s Algorithm for Adjacency List RepresentationPrinting Paths in Dijkstra’s Shortest Path AlgorithmDijkstra’s shortest path algorithm using set in STLPlease write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " The Floyd Warshall Algorithm is for solving the All Pairs Shortest Path problem. The problem is to find shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge weighted directed Graph. Example:Floyd Warshall Algorithm We initialize the solution matrix same as the input graph matrix as a first step. Then we update the solution matrix by considering all vertices as an intermediate vertex. The idea is to one by one pick all vertices and updates all shortest paths which include the picked vertex as an intermediate vertex in the shortest path. When we pick vertex number k as an intermediate vertex, we already have considered vertices {0, 1, 2, .. k-1} as intermediate vertices. For every pair (i, j) of the source and destination vertices respectively, there are two possible cases. 1) k is not an intermediate vertex in shortest path from i to j. We keep the value of dist[i][j] as it is. 2) k is an intermediate vertex in shortest path from i to j. We update the value of dist[i][j] as dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]The following figure shows the above optimal substructure property in the all-pairs shortest path problem.Following is implementations of the Floyd Warshall algorithm.Output:Time Complexity: O(V^3)The above program only prints the shortest distances. We can modify the solution to print the shortest paths also by storing the predecessor information in a separate 2D matrix. Also, the value of INF can be taken as INT_MAX from limits.h to make sure that we handle maximum possible value. When we take INF as INT_MAX, we need to change the if condition in the above program to avoid arithmetic overflow.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed aboveWriting code in comment?\n",

But unlike the Naive algorithm, Rabin Karp algorithm matches the hash value of the pattern with the hash value of current substring of text, and if the hash values match then only it starts matching individual characters. So Rabin Karp algorithm needs to calculate hash values for following strings.1) Pattern itself. 2) All the substrings of the text of length m.Since we need to efficiently calculate hash values for all the substrings of size m of text, we must have a hash function which has the following property. Hash at the next shift must be efficiently computable from the current hash value and next character in text or we can say hash(txt[s+1 .. s+m]) must be efficiently computable from hash(txt[s .. s+m-1]) and txt[s+m] i.e., hash(txt[s+1 .. s+m])= rehash(txt[s+m], hash(txt[s .. s+m-1])) and rehash must be O(1) operation.The hash function suggested by Rabin and Karp calculates an integer value. The integer value for a string is the numeric value of a string.For example, if all possible characters are from 1 to 10, the numeric value of “122” will be 122. The number of possible characters is higher than 10 (256 in general) and pattern length can be large. So the numeric values cannot be practically stored as an integer. Therefore, the numeric value is calculated using modular arithmetic to make sure that the hash values can be stored in an integer variable (can fit in memory words). To do rehashing, we need to take off the most significant digit and add the new least significant digit for in hash value. Rehashing is done using the following formula.hash( txt[s+1 .. s+m] ) = ( d ( hash( txt[s .. s+m-1]) – txt[s]*h ) + txt[s + m] ) mod q hash( txt[s .. s+m-1] ) : Hash value at shift s. hash( txt[s+1 .. s+m] ) : Hash value at next shift (or shift s+1) d: Number of characters in the alphabet q: A prime number h: d^(m-1)How does the above expression work?This is simple mathematics, we compute decimal value of current window from previous window. For example pattern length is 3 and string is “23456” You compute the value of first window (which is “234”) as 234. How  will you compute value of next window “345”? You will do (234 – 2*100)*10 + 5 and get 345.Output:Time Complexity:The average and best-case running time of the Rabin-Karp algorithm is O(n+m), but its worst-case time is O(nm). Worst case of Rabin-Karp algorithm occurs when all characters of pattern and text are same as the hash values of all the substrings of txt[] match with hash value of pat[]. For example pat[] = “AAA” and txt[] = “AAAAAAA”.?list=PLqM7alHXFySGwXaessYMemAnITqlZdZVEPlease write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.References:http://net.pku.edu.cn/~course/cs101/2007/resource/Intro2Algorithm/book6/chap34.htmhttp://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall04/cos226/lectures/string.4up.pdfhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin-Karp_string_search_algorithmRelated Posts: Searching for Patterns | Set 1 (Naive Pattern Searching) Searching for Patterns | Set 2 (KMP Algorithm)Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Choosing the right company is a must as your entire career will depend on the skills you learn and the abilities you have. Everyone wants to be in a company that helps in improving their skills and provides you a better learning environment. Before choosing your dream company, almost every student comes across the question that should I choose a Product Based Company or a Service-Based Company? Also, What exactly do Product Based Companies and Service-Based Companies mean and how to get into these?The biggest confusion among the students is that the top tech-giants such as Google, Amazon, etc. hire only students from IITs or NITs, which is the biggest myth. If you have the ability, and you have the desired skills, then you can get into your dream company even after being from a tier-3 college. All you need is hard work and consistency.In Product Based companies, there are smaller teams, and employee-friendly policies whereas in the later there are larger teams and fewer employee-friendly policies. It is clear that Product Based Companies are better than the Service-Based ones, but if you are not able to get into the former one but have the opportunity to work in a service-based one, then don’t miss it. Something is better than nothing. You can get hands-on experience from there too and after some experience, you can switch to the Product-Based one.Product-Based CompanyService-Based CompanyWriting code in comment?\n",

      " Python is not only one of the most loved languages but rather it is used in various different domains. Due to its high dependency and usage in a lot of fields, there has suddenly been an increase in the job openings in Python programming language and related frameworks. Python developers are in high demand as it solves problems effortlessly in areas like web development, data science, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. 2021 saw a substantial rise in job openings for Python developers.Therefore, acing for a Python role does not only mean you have to be good at Python libraries, modules, data structures but also be able to write clean code without redundant code. This means Python already provides a lot of in-built methods and libraries so that you don’t have to write long redundant codes. Let us look at this by one so that you can clear your Python interview flawlessly!Python uses string formatting similar to that of C-language to create new, formatted strings. To inculcate string formatting in your code, there are three ways you can implement it: with the help of placeholders, using the format() method, and formatting using string literals i.e., f-strings. When using the placeholder method, we need to use the modulo (%) operator along with s, d, f or b characters, where s means inserting a string, d means inserting decimal values, f means floating-point values and b means inserting binary value. When using the format() method, we need to pass in the string values as arguments that are to be replaced in the original string. It can also insert multiple values using indexes in the actual string. The final method, by using f-strings, was introduced in Python 3.6 and above. Here, we append the original string to the character f and then place variables inside the string in curly braces.To learn more about it, must read: String Formatting in PythonUsing list comprehensions is great when working with smaller lists. If list comprehension is used for larger lists, it often ends up consuming a lot of time thereby slowing down your program. Therefore, Python provides generators that help to create your own iterator functions. It is a special type of Python function which rather than providing a single value, provides an iterator object with a sequence of values. In normal functions, we use a return keyword, but in generator functions, we use yield keyword. The return statement terminates the function whereas yield only pauses the execution while maintaining an internal state of the function.To learn more about it, must read: Generators in PythonWe all use Python iterables but what if we need a counter to keep a track of all the items in the current iterable? Python provides a method called enumerate() which adds a counter to an iterable and after that returns it in a form of an enumerate object. It can also be used in loop constructs where having a counter to every item in the iterable is needed.To learn more about it, must read: Enumerate Method in PythonPython has an amazing module called collection which is used to implement container data types, namely lists, dict, set, tuple to get rid of their shortcomings. It provides specialized data structures: namedtuple(), UserList, UserDict, UserString, deque, Chainmap, Counter, OrderedDict and defaultdict. Using these in your code increases its performance to a great extent and also makes day-to-day programming easier for Python developers.To learn more about it, must read: Python Collections ModulePython provides a built-in function called sort() which sorts the list, by default, in ascending order. But it not just limited to sorting lists, rather, we can pass various arguments to this function to customize the results as per our needs. Firstly, we can pass reverse=True in the sort method so we can receive the list in descending order. Secondly, we can pass a value to the key which is a function and serves as a key for the sorting comparison. For example, if we have a list of strings and we want to sort them based on their height, we will follow this syntax: list_input.sort(key=len).To read more about it, must read: sort() in PythonWe all admit to use print() while debugging our Python codes and passing all sorts of weird strings to check until which line the print executes. But, that is a bad approach and should not be used when Python provides a function called breakpoint() to test the code at lines where we think there can be potential bugs or errors. There are a few statements that are used for purposes like continuing execution, quitting debugger, going to the next line within the same or the called function.To read more about it, must read: Debugging in Python**kwargs in Python is used in function definitions and is generally used to pass a keyworded argument list which could be of variable length. The double wildcard indicates that there is no restriction to the number of keyword of arguments that can be passed (variable-length). To use this, we need to provide names to the arguments that we are passing and they can eventually be retrieved just like dictionaries, without any particular order.To learn more about it, must read: **kwargs in PythonThese are one of the most used AND/OS built-in that Python provides and definitely reduce your code to a great extent. The keyword any is used when we need to check if even any single item is True. To easily visualize it, we can think of it as a successive OR operation on the iterable on which it is called. Whereas, all is used to check if each and every item in the iterable is true. Both of these are short circuit operators and stop as soon as a false is encountered in all or a true is encountered in any.To learn more about it, must read: All Any in PythonWe have seen various Python tips and tricks that you must know as a developer and will help you keep an edge over candidates in your Python coding interviews!Writing code in comment?\n",

      " HTML…One of the easiest things to learn is programming. Most of the newbies and even kids step into programming picking up HTML. They learn, they build some web pages but a lot of developers even experienced one make some silly mistake while writing the code for frontend. Making these silly mistakes not only annoys other developers (when they need to make some changes) but also hurts your main site and drives the end-user away. We are going to mention some common and best practices which you should follow to write a clean and clear HTML code.Following some common practices makes debugging easier and saves a lot of time. It also helps in search engine optimization as well.Example:To avoid validation and compatibility issue don’t forget to close all the tags in your code. Today most of the text editors come up with features that close the HTML tags automatically still, it’s a good practice(and definitely for final check) to make sure that you don’t miss any parent or nested tag that is not closed. In HTML5 it’s optional to close HTML tags but according to W3C specification, you should close all the HTML tags to avoid any validation error in the future.Make a habit to use lowercase for all the tags, attributes, and values in HTML code. It is an industry-standard practice and it also makes your code much more readable. Capitalizing the tags won’t affect the result in your browser but it’s a good practice to write elements in lowercase. Writing your code in lowercase is easy and it also looks cleaner.Example:When you add an image in your HTML code don’t forget to add alt attribute for validation and accessibility reasons. Also, make sure that you choose the right description for the alt attribute. Search engines rank your page lower as a result when you don’t mention alt attributes with an image. It’s also good to mention the height and width of the image. It reduces flickering because the browser can reserve space for the image before loading.Example:A lot of newbies make this mistake that they add inline-style in HTML tags. It makes your code complicated and difficult to maintain. Make a habit to keep your styles separate from HTML mark-up. Using inline styles can create so many problems. It makes your code cluttered, unreadable, and hard to update or maintain. Separating HTML with CSS also helps other developers to make changes in code very easily.Example:HTML title really matters a lot when it comes to search engine optimization or ranking of your page. Always try to make your title as meaningful as possible. The title of your HTML page appears in the google search engine result page and the indexing of your site relies on it. A meta description tells the user what the page is all about, so make it descriptive that clearly specifies the purpose of your website or page. Avoid using repeated words and phrases. When a user types some keyword in the search engine bar that keyword is picked up by the search engine spiders and then it is used to find the relevant page for users based on the matching keyword used in meta tags.Example:Heading tags also play a crucial role in making your website search engine-friendly. HTML has 6 different types of heading tags that should be used carefully. Learn to use <h1> to <h6> elements to denote your HTML’s content hierarchy also make sure that you use only one h1 per page. In W3C specs it is mentioned that your page content should be described by a single tag so you can add your most important text within h1 such as article title or blog post.Example:A lot of beginners make a common mistake using the wrong HTML elements. They need to learn with time which element should be used where. We recommend you learn about all the HTML elements and use them correctly for a meaningful content structure. For example instead of using <br> between two paragraphs you can use CSS margin and/or padding properties. Learn when to use <em> and when to use <i> (both looks the same), learn when to use <b> and when to use <strong> (both looks the same). It comes with practice and when you keep your eyes on good code written by other developers. Another good example is given below.it is important to give proper space or indentation in your HTML code to make it more readable and manageable. Avoid writing everything in one line. It makes your code cluttered and flat. When you use the nested element give proper indentation so that users can identify the beginning and end of the tag. A code that follows proper formatting is easy to change and looks nice to other developers. It’s a good coding practice that reduces development time as well.Last but not least make a habit to validate your HTML code frequently. Validating your code is a great piece of work and helps in finding difficult issues. You can download the W3C markup validation or Firefox developers toolbar to validate your site by URL. Validators are very helpful in detecting errors and resolving them.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " COVID-19 has done something that was considered impossible until now. It has brought the whole world to a standstill and confined people to their homes in all parts of the world. In such a difficult situation, the only way forward is to work together to limit the negative impacts of COVID-19 so that the maximum number of people can survive this epidemic with minimal impact on the economy so that people still have jobs when this is over.Thankfully, many tech companies are working together and with various central governments to help in reducing the damage caused by COVID-19 as much as possible. There are mainly two ways companies can go about this, one is to provide their technical resources in helping to diagnose the virus, creating a vaccine, preventing the spread of misinformation, etc. The other way is to provide financial help by supporting their employees so that they don’t lose their jobs, providing aid to many people who have lost their jobs and other humanitarian efforts. Tech companies are helping people using both these ways by using all the resources at their disposal. So let’s see how five very popular tech companies, in particular, are dealing with this epidemic and helping fight COVID-19.Google is the biggest and most famous tech company ever! So it stands to reason that it can help in this fight against COVID-19 by providing the correct information to the people and also supporting the government using technology. And Google is trying it’s best! It is working with the US government to create a website that provides all the resources and information about COVID-19 in one place. In the meantime, all Google products like YouTube, Google Search, etc. are providing updated information about COVID-19 to people so that there is less panic due to misinformation.Google is also contributing in more direct ways by trying to identify the working of COVID-19 so that scientists can develop a vaccine. AlphaFold system is a neural network that is designed to predict the protein structure of any given compound. As you may have guessed, Google is using AlphaFold to predict the protein structure of SARS-CoV-2 which is the particular virus that causes COVID-19. If Google is able to manage this, it will be extremely helpful to the scientific community in developing a vaccine as soon as possible.Verily Life Sciences, a sister company of Google is also working to detect COVID-19 in people. It has developed mobile centers where all registered users can get free tests to see if they have COVID-19 or not. While this is an experimental initiative only in California and Pennsylvania, if it is successful it may expand to other states in the USA or maybe beyond the country.Microsoft was the first company that initiated work from home for its employees following the outbreak of COVID-19. They have also provided other relief measures to their employees like paying freelancers their hourly wages, paid leave for employees with young children who can’t work from home, etc. All in all, the productivity of Microsoft employees hasn’t decreased with working from home, proving that it can be done without issues!Microsoft has also partnered with the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) to create a chatbot called the COVID-19 Self-Checker which is available on their website. This chatbot allows people to analyze their symptoms to check if they have COVID-19. If they do, then it also helps in checking the severity of their symptoms and provides access to medical professionals in extreme cases. This COVID-19 Self-Checker chatbot is based on Artificial Intelligence and built using Microsoft’s Azure public cloud service.Microsoft is also helping to manage the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 by creating a real-time interactive map of the regions affected by COVID-19 on their Bing dashboard. This map uses data collected and approved by the World Health Organisation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the European Centre for Diseases Prevention and then displays information about the number of infected and recovered people all over the world.Just like other tech companies, IBM is also doing all it can to help in fighting the COVID-19. To fight the spread of misinformation, IBM has trained its Watson Assistant to answer any questions people may have about COVID 19. The IBM Watson Assistant is a conversational Artificial Intelligence platform that has been trained using the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) data guidance about COVID-19.IBM is also a part of the COVID-19 High-Performance Computing Consortium which is created by a combination of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the U.S. Department of Energy and IBM. This consortium aims to provide some of the world’s most powerful and advanced computers (such as those that IBM has) to scientists so that they can complete research and computations in areas like bioinformatics, molecular modeling, etc. much faster. Carrying out these computations on normal computers would take months compared to hours on supercomputers and this will help in developing a vaccine quickly so that COVID 19 can be stopped.IBM is also providing detailed tracking data about COVID-19 on the Weather Channel by using data collected from various governments, the World Health Organisation, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, etc.The outbreak of COVID-19 has hit Apple pretty hard as most of their production occurs in China and a lot of their customer base is also in China. However, Apple has recovered and is doing a lot to manage the impact of COVID-19 on the world. Apple has updated Siri to answer any questions people may have about COVID 19. Siri also allows people to check if they have COVID-19 by answering YES or NO questions related to their symptoms.Apple has also partnered with Google to enable Contact Tracing so that people can identify if they ever came in contact with someone who has COVID-19. This will be done using third-party apps that users can download using the iOS and Android app stores. These apps will allow contact tracing using Bluetooth so that people will get an alert if they ever came into contact with someone who afterward tested positive for COVID-19 and then they can exercise precaution so that they don’t spread it further if they have it.In addition to these measures, Apple is also helping its employees as much as possible. They are still providing hourly wages to their employees who are unable to work as their job is not possible under work from home conditions, such as retail employees. Apple has also matched its employee donations two-to-one on a national and international level and donated around 10 million masks to the hospitals in the US.Amazon is also working to protect it’s employees as much as possible. While they have not provided work from home everywhere as it is not possible for delivery people and Amazon warehouse workers, they have provided masks for their employees and implemented temperature checks to reduce the spread of COVID-19 as much as possible. They have also increased the pay rates of their hourly employees by $2/hour in the U.S and €2/hour in many of the European countries. Amazon has also opened up 100, 000 new jobs to manage delivery demand and also support people who may have lost their jobs because of COVID-19.Amazon Web Services has also launched the Diagnostic Development Initiative that will help scientists using AWS to conduct research on the accurate and fast diagnosis of COVID-19 as a diagnosis is the first step in eradicating this crisis. Moreover, diagnosis is often underfunded and so AWS is providing scientists with reliable and scalable computational power along with services like machine learning so that they can process and analyze data much faster in order to reduce the time taken for COVID-19 diagnosis. To fund this project, Amazon is providing an initial investment of $20 million that will help in increasing the speed of diagnosis for COVID-19 and other infectious disease outbreaks in the future.Amazon is also using Alexa which is an artificial intelligence virtual assistant to provide information about COVID-19 and answer any questions people may have. Alexa uses data from credible institutions like the Center for Disease Control in the USA, Indian Council for Medical Research in India, etc.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " Do you remember, why did you start your college journey? To make a successful career, needless to say! And what are you doing now to make it possible? Well, most of the students get indulged into the theoretical stuff, CGPA, etc. These things are quite okay but students need to realize that they can stretch themselves and they can do much more beyond their potential. College acts as a platform and if they can make network with companies during their college days then time can be utilized more efficiently. They should try to involve themselves in various drives (seminars, contests, etc.) and build a network – all through their college!Let us take an example. There are 2 students – A and B. A is a student having good academic records while B has an average academic record. However, B always remains in the touch of various companies via associating them in workshops, seminars, contests, etc. and explores more in comparison of A. Now, according to you, who will be more preferable by the companies during placement? Although it depends upon the company’s selection criteria, but the chances are that the company will prefer to select B over A. Why..?? Because it is true that academics should be the highest priority but a student should also be proactive in connecting with the potential organizations or companies and in grabbing the opportunity. There are a lot more benefits of associating with companies during college, some of these are mentioned below:As of now, you must be aware of why you should associate with companies during college and what are its benefits. But wait…do you know how can you come in contact with such companies and associate them? No worries! We will let you know about the strategical approach regarding the same.As nowadays most of the companies are involving in Campus Ambassador Programs, so it is the most trending and efficient way to get associate with companies during your college span. There are various platforms such as GeeksforGeeks that offer you to be a part of their organization by becoming their representative in your college campus. You can represent any organization through various schemes such as promote their events, conduct seminars, and workshops, etc. However, every organization has its own criteria to select a candidate as their representative but there are several guidelines following which you can easily go through the process.In the same context, let’s discuss the most sought-after campus ambassador program – GeeksforGeeks Campus Mantri Program. GeeksforGeeks is one the leading player in the Computer Science domain and with their Campus Mantri Programme, you can get a chance to be a part of their exciting journey. This Campus Mantri Programme offers you a platform to become the Campus Ambassador of the organization at your college.

      " The most valuable item for any company in modern times is data! Companies can work much more efficiently by analyzing large amounts of data and making business decisions on that basis. This means that Big Data Analytics is the current path to profit! So is it any surprise that more and more companies are gradually turning towards a data-based business model?Big Data Analytics is much more objective than the older methods and companies can make the correct business decisions using data insights. There was a time when companies could only interact with their customers on one in stores. And there was no way to know what individual customers wanted on a large scale. But that has all changed with the coming of Big Data Analytics. Now companies can directly engage with each customer online personally and know what they want!So let’s see the different ways companies can use Big Data Analytics in the real world to improve their performance and become even more successful (and rich!) with time.No company can exist without customers! And so attracting customers and even more importantly, retaining those customers is necessary for a company. And Big Data Analytics can certainly help with that! Big Data Analytics allows a company to observe customer trends and then market their products specifically keeping their customers in mind. And the more data that a company has about its customer base, the more accurately they can observe customer trends and patterns which will ensure that the company can deliver exactly what its customers want. And this is the best way to increase customer retention. After all, happy customers mean loyal customers!An example of a company that uses Big Data Analytics to Increase Customer Retention is Amazon. Amazon collects all the data about its customers such as their names, addresses, search history, payments, etc. so that it can provide a truly personalized experience. This means that Amazon knows who you are as soon as you log in! It also provides you product recommendations based on your history so you are more likely to buy things. And if you buy lots of things on Amazon, you are less likely to leave Amazon!How can a company reach new customers? Marketing campaigns! However, if a great marketing campaign can get customers for a company, a poor marketing campaign can make a company lose even its existing customers. And so Big Data Analytics is necessary to analyze the customer base and understand what people want so that the marketing campaign is successful in converting more people. This can be done by monitoring the current online trends, understanding customer behavior in the market and then cashing on that to create a successful marketing campaign.An example of a company that uses Big Data Analytics to create Marketing Campaigns is Netflix. Have you noticed that as soon as you open Netflix, they have movies and series marketed specifically for you? They do this by collecting data on your watching habits and search history and then providing targeted adverts. So if you have been watching mystery movies recently, that’s what you will be recommended in the future as well!A company cannot sustain itself if they don’t have a successful risk management plan. After all, how is a big company supposed to function if they cannot even find risks ahead of time and then work to minimize them as much as possible? And this is where Big Data Analytics comes in! It can be used to collect and analyze the vast internal data available in the company archives that can help in developing both short term and long term risk management models. Using these, the company can identify future risks and make much more strategic business decisions. That means much more money in the future!!!An example of a company that uses Big Data Analytics for Risk Management is Starbucks. Did you know that Starbucks can have multiple stores on a single street and all of them are successful? This is because Starbucks does great risk analysis as well as providing great coffee! They collect data like location data, demographic data, customer preferences, traffic levels, etc. of any location they plan to open a shop and only do it if the chances of success are high and the associated risk is minimal. So they can even choose locations that are close together as long as there is more profit and less risk.The supply chain begins with the creation of raw materials and ends at the finished products in the hands of the customers. And for large companies, it is very difficult to handle this supply chain. After all, it can contain thousands of people and products that are moving from the point of manufacture to the point of consumption! So companies can use Big Data Analytics to analyze their raw materials, products in their warehouse inventories and their retailer details to understand their production and shipment needs. This will make Supply Chain Handling much easier which will lead to fewer errors and consequently fewer losses for the company.An example of a company that uses Big Data Analytics for Supply Chain Handling is PepsiCo. While the most popular thing sold by PepsiCo is Pepsi of course, did you know they sell many other things like Mountain Dew, Lays, 7Up, Doritos, etc. all over the world! And it is very difficult to manage the Supply Chain Handling of so many things without using Big Data Analytics. So PepsiCo uses data to calculate the amount and type of products that retailers want without any wastage occurring.All companies are trying to create products that their customers want. Well, what if companies were able to first understand what their customers want and then create products? They would surely be successful! That’s what Big Data Analytics aims to do for Product Creation. Companies can use data like previous product response, customer feedback forms, competitor product successes, etc. to understand what types of products customers want and then work on that. In this way, companies can create new products as well as improve their previous products according to market demand and become much more successful and popular.An example of a company that uses Big Data Analytics for Product Creation is Burberry, a British luxury fashion house. They provide luxury with technology! This is done by targeting customers on an individual level to find out the products that they want and focusing on those. Burberry store employees can also see your online purchase history and preferences and recommend matching accessories with your clothes. And this makes a truly personalized product experience which is only possible with Big Data Analytics.Writing code in comment?\n",

      " As a beginner when it comes to learning a new language everyone’s favorite is Python. A lot of companies working on different kinds of applications and dealing with millions of users expect a fast, scalable and dynamic website. The choice of programming languages and frameworks is enormous in the market but choosing the best one that fulfills most of the requirements can be a tough task for the organizations. Today, the IT industry is familiar with the popularity of Python language. How easy it is to learn this language and how this language has solved a lot of problems with the organization running different kinds of applications. Python and the frameworks of this language truly deserve hype in the market.For building highly scalable web applications with a constantly growing audience (e.g. content-based or news sites), Django is one of the most popular web frameworks of Python. The framework is clear and simple, fast and reliable, flexible and scalable. Django has a huge loyal contributing community and this framework helps you to get your job done with fewer lines of code. According to SimilarTech, there were 77, 278 websites built with Django as of May 2019. If you want to know why Django is gaining so much popularity then you should check out some of the famous websites that have grown and evolved using this technology. Let’s take a closer look at the best Django sites out there.Disqus is the largest project so far built on the Django framework from scratch. The website allows you to implement comments and discussion options on your site. It offers an easy-to-use plug-in for comments, analyzes audience activity, advertises, and access customer engagement tools. The community has reached nearly 500 million unique visitors every month across 191 countries with more than 17 million monthly page views. Around 750,000 websites using Disqus, with about 35 million users participating in these communities. The website handles more than 50 million comments per month. It’s a Django framework running behind the scene that helped Disqus to scale their application for handling millions of users and for better performance as well.Disqus team also used this framework to build an internal tool Sentry for error reporting, debugging, and fixing app crashes. Today, Sentry is pretty popular among developers and it has become an open-source software used by 30, 000+ organizations including Instagram, Reddit, Doordash, Datadog, and Prezi. Disqus is now using other frameworks as well, but the team is still working on Django because of the huge community support and a wide selection of ready-to-implement solutions.This “video-sharing platform” needs no introduction. Earlier the site was built on Php but the youtube team felt the need to improve its performance and add new functionalities in it. Continuous rapid audience growth forced the youtube team to choose the Django framework and the choice was fully justified. Django helped the YouTube team of developers, allowing them to act quickly & flawlessly. They used this framework to implement new features and to maintain the speed of the website.Again this site needs no introduction. Instagram is the fastest-growing photo and video sharing app which is quite popular in the world. Kevin and Mike, co-founders of Instagram developed the first version of this app using Django. It was super easy to work with Django and it didn’t require a lot of decisions and a lot of setups. Every day, Instagram users add 95 million photos and give 4.2 billion likes under the pictures and videos. Django helped Instagram to scale the application, process huge amounts of data and manage a greater number of interactions between users every single second. The ready to implement solution available in Django allowed the team to focus on UI and UX of the app instead of worrying about the backend technology that makes them work. According to Hui Ding, the former head of engineering at Instagram“We had been able to get to a few hundred million users with our Python/Django stack, so we decided we would continue. Also significant in the decision was that our engineers love Python. It’s a reason people want to come to work for us.”Instagram uses Sentry tool (developed by Disqus) to monitor and detect errors across the system in real-time.This music streaming app changed the way people listen to, share and purchase music. The huge library of this application is accessible everywhere and on any device. It contains a vast amount of data and to handle this data the application uses Python alongside Django. There were mainly two reasons for choosing this framework…To provide users with customized auto-generated playlists, Spotify benefits from Machine Learning with Python. Django provided the full range of Python features to handle the web application.Forget about the day when your source code was on your machine only. Today Github and Bitbucket are quite popular in the market for hosting your repository online. Bitbucket is a cloud-based Git repository hosting service that was launched in 2008. Today, this platform handles a heavy load of users with 17 million requests and 6 million repositories in a year. The core technology behind this platform is Python paired with Django. Bitbucket uses Django for several reasons. The first one is the thousands of wide and vibrant community of developers. The second reason is Django offers a lot of ready-to-implement solutions that save a lot of time for developers. This way, they don’t have to worry about building every single feature from scratch.Dropbox is the most popular cloud-based storage platform for documents, video, pictures, graphics, and so on. The application allows its users to access the files anywhere, anytime and from any device. From the start, Dropbox has been using Python as the main technology in its tech stack and the company also hired the man Guido van Rossum who created Python. The team was able to develop the product relatively fast using Python for both the server and the desktop client software. Dropbox developers choose Django to add the user history option, synchronize an account across different devices, and to add various types of file-sharing options.Mozilla is the second most popular browser in the world so there is no need to say how many people use it. Initially, Php and CakePHP was the core technology stack for Mozilla but later when numbers of users started increasing the platform grew and it had to deal with millions of searches daily. To manage high traffic and to improve efficiency the team had to adopt new technology. So the team decided to move on from PHP+CakePHP to Python+Django. They got the benefit of it and the platform becomes much more capable to handle hundreds of millions of views per month, and even more API hits per day. Today, all the Mozilla support site and the add-ons are powered by Django.Pinterest is another popular social media platform that allows it’s users to find ideas like recipes, home and style inspiration. Pinterest has 250 million monthly active users so the website has to deal with a heavy load of users. To ensure excellent performance the website uses Django. Django provides the ability to scale effectively without affecting its speed. It’s Django behind the scene that helped developers to manage the website, allowing it’s users to follow each other and share boards and pins.You may be surprised after reading an interesting fact that Django was first created to support the content web app for the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper publisher. Well, the framework is still popular among news apps and it is used by the most influential newspaper in the world, The Washington Post. This popular news app taking advantage of this framework and handles the huge traffic very well with fast and efficient performance. The Washington Post website, which is written solely in Django, hit 172 million total monthly visits in March 2019. Other similar apps such as The Guardian, the satirical newspaper The Onion, and partially by The New York Times also uses the Django framework to scale their website and to handle large amounts of data generated by the daily audience.Eventbrite is another success story of Django. The website was launched in 2006 and it provides event management and ticketing service. Eventbrite was originally built on Python and in-house frameworks but due to rapid audience growth, the platform started facing scalability issues. In 2010 the developer’s team decided to move on to the Django framework. It helped developers to scale their website and to handle as many hits per second as possible. Django becomes a solid foundation for the future development and growth of the entire Eventbrite website.The list doesn’t end here. There are still some popular websites using Django in their tech stack and got the benefit of using this framework. Some other popular websites are… Prezi, NASA, National Geographic, Quora, The Onion, Reddit, Udemy, Robinhood and many more are out there.So Django is a perfect solution for both startups and large companies. Scalability is one of the best features of Django and it enables any application to handle any audience volume growth with efficiency as well. If you aim to deliver the product quickly and at an efficient cost then you should think about using this framework for your next project.Writing code in comment?\n",
